Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based. (source: wikipedia)</p>\n<h5>What is Canon?!</h5>\n<p>It's important to respect canon. This might be a weird word, but let us explain. Example: People in Harry Potter books fly brooms. Giving Hermoine the ability to fly without a broom (or dark magic) would be disrespectful to canon. Changing Hermoine's life however is acceptable. You could, for example, write about Hermoine's parents. They are Muggle and that greatly affects her life (she chose to erase herself from their memory and that hurts her.) You could write a story in which Hermoine is not born from Muggle parents but from wizard parents. Describe how that could affect her personality. Maybe Hermoine is such a great student because she continuously had to prove she herself is a good wizard even though she is Muggle born. If her parents hadn't been muggles she might have worked less hard which could've affected Harry in many ways as well. Hermoine helped Harry in with her knowledge she had acquired by hard work. Had she been less motivated to learn Harry would've faced more challenges alone.</p>\n"
