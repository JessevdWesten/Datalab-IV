But most of the book is in de human world.</p>\n<p>Time: It's a fantasy book so I'm not sure. I think that it's possible that it's in this time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Character:</p>\n<p>Artemis : is a brilliant twelve-year-old criminal, has no father in the house and his mother is crazy in her head and lives most of the time with her mind in the past. He wants the gold of the fairies, so he kidnapped Holly.</p>\n<p>Butler : is a helper/bodyguard of the Fowl family. He's trained at a academy and helps and protect Artemis. He has a little sister, Juliet.</p>\n<p>Juliet : is the little sister of Butler and the helper/bodyguard of Artemis' mother. She also helps with that Holly can't escape.</p>\n<p>Root : is a fairy and works by a kind of police, the LEP. He's Holly's and Foaly's boss and commander of the LEP.</p>\n<p>Foaly : is an agent at the LEP and works with the computer and technic.</p>\n<p>Holly Short : is the only woman fairy at the LEP and is a captain. She get kidnapped by Artemis and if the LEP wants Holly back. Then they get to pay the gold. At the beginning of the story she doesn't have magic. In the end she has her magic.</p>\n<p>The troll : the troll is a big, hairy kind of animal. And it attacks the people. The LEP trying to stop the trolls and safe the people.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Artemis Fowl is a clever boy and he goes to a fairy and makes pictures of the book the fairy has. The book is written in fairy langue and Artemis translate the entire book. So now he knows all the rules of the fairies. And because he wants their gold, he try to play the game so that they can't do anything, because it should be against the rules.</p>\n<p>Holly is a LEP agent and the only female agent. She wants to improve herself and goes after an emergency, a troll. She lose her magic and when she is on her way to get it back, she get kidnapped by Artemis. Because Artemis has a book with the rules of the fairies, he is always one step ahead. Root and Foaly and the rest of the LEP wants to safe Holly, but not for the gold. So they putting a time-field over the place where Holly and Artemis are. There will stop the time, but only for a particular time. Root tries to be more clever then Artemis but he doesn't know that Artemis has the book. So Roots' plan failed. And in that time Holly escape because Artemis made a little mistake. So when a other officer gives the command to get a troll in there. Holly does her job and protect Butler and Juliet. So the Root makes a plan to get her out, by giving the gold. And if she is away, they blow it all up. And because they think Artemis is trapped in the time-field, they think he will died and they can take back their gold. And if they give the gold to Artemis, he does a wish by Holly and return the halve of the gold. And because Artemis, who reads the book know that by falling asleep he can escaping the time-field. And the rule of the fairies is that if you lose, you lose and can't take revenge, the game is played and Artemis wins. And he's wish come true because his mother isn't always in the past with her thought anymore and it a real mother of her son.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It was a good book and there happened much. The switching of perspective is a thing I like, that keeps it interesting. And the characters were nice. But I didn't like the story so much. I don't know, I like fantasy but it wasn't that I wanted to read by myself. This was the first book of it, it was nice but I don't think I'm going to read the other ones. Also because I found books that seem also nice to me. And it wasn't that fun to read, so I don't going to read a kind of the same. I think it's a good book, but I also read it because I have to. I think if I really knew what kind of book it was I hadn't choose it. What I did like about the fantasy part, because in a fantasy book everything is possible so I read many books like this. But I think it wasn't interesting enough. And it was a bit basic. With fairies and trolls, I like more the things in a other magic type. It clearly wasn't what I had expected. I don't say it was a bad book, but it wasn't the kind of book I like.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n"

His grandfather Abraham Portman told him stories about peculiar children. One was invisible, another could fly and others were super strong. And they lived in a house where nobody could find them, because there were monsters, the hollow, that were against them.  When Jacob grew older, his grandfather went crazy. One day Jacob goes to his grandfather, but he isn't home. His grandfather lived near a wood, so Jacob ran into the wood to search for is grandfather. When he found him, his grandfather was nearly dead. His grandfather sold him: 'Find the bird. In the loop. On the other side of the old man's grave. September third, 1940.' And then he dead. Jacob saw one of the monsters that his grandfather told him about. Later when the police started an investigation Jacob's friend Ricky, who was there with him, said that there was nothing in the wood. So everybody thought that Jacob was crazy. He went to a therapist, Doctor Golan, to talk about his grandfathers relation with him and why he thought he saw the creature. If Franklin Portman, Jacob's father, and Jacob's aunt wanted to clean the house of his grandfather, they ask if Jacob wants to come with them. Jacob found a box with photos of the peculiar children in his grandfather's house. Later he discussed with his therapist he wanted to go to the island. So Jacob went with his father to the island.  After a few weeks he found the house where his grandfather lived when he was young. On the island they told him that at September third, 1940 there fell bombs at the island and at the house. In the house Jacob found a box with more photos of the children. Jacob went to the house every day. One day when he was in the house, he saw children he knew from the pictures. When the children saw him, they ran away. He followed one of them through a portal. First she thought that he was a kind of hollow. But after thinking about it, she brought him to the house. Jacob saw that he wasn't at the island anymore. At the house he met \"the bird\", Miss Alma Peregrine. They called her the bird because she could turn into a bird, the peregrine. She welcomed him and introduced him to Emma Bloom, the girl that brought him to the house. She was one of the peculiar children because she could make fire in her hands. He also met the girl that could fly, Olive Abroholos Elephanta, well actually she couldn't fly. But if she removed her leaden shoes, she came free form the earth. He also get introduced to the invisible boy, Millard Nullings, and Bronwyn Bruntley a very strong girl and many other children. They tell him that he is peculiar too, like his grandfather. They both can see the for others invisible hollows. Hollows are shadows, so in the daylight everybody is able to see them a bit. That's why they usually come at night. Miss Peregrine tells him at he's in a loop. Every night when the bombs fall, the loop will start again. The loop repeat the September third, 1940 again and again. They told him that his grandfather had left, because he wanted to fight in the war. After the war he never came back. Emma Bloom and his grandfather were a couple, but Abraham didn't come back and started a new live in America. Jacob fell in love with Emma too, and she with him. Because his father were on the island too, Jacob travelled between the two times. When a \"bird\" from another loop came to Miss Peregrine, they knew there was something wrong. The hollows had took many other birds and killed the peculiar children. Jacob wasn't allowed to go home for his and the others safety. But he did and some came with him. They got taken by a hollow and he knew Jacob, because it was Doctor Golan. They escaped, but when they were back at the house Miss Peregrine and the other bird were gone. Doctor Golan kidnapped them. Emma, Jacob, Millard and Bronwyn were going to rescue them. In that time Jacob decided to stay with the peculiar children and don't go home anymore. They only had the change to save Miss Peregrine, but because she had turned into a bird and she couldn't turn back. The loop had broken. So the house was destroyed because of the bombs. In the end they decided to leave the island and so searching for another loop.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>My opinion is fantastic! I liked it very much. The beginning before he found the house was a bit long for me, but never bored. The strange pictures kept it interesting too. The story is well written and super fun. There wasn't a bored part for me at all. Also in the first beginning when his grandfather told him stories, it just needed your attention. You wanted to know more about them. And when his grandfather died and everybody thought Jacob was crazy, you just read that because everybody said it, he started to believe it too. It's a amazing book and I liked it very much.</p>\n"

She is also the love of the two Calore brothers. Mare is a member of the Scarlet Guard and because of the things in the other books, she is an important one. She hates Maven for what he did to her.</p>\n<p>Cal Calore: a silver blood with the powers of fire and he is the rightful king of Norta. He and Mare are in love, but for his crone he married Evangeline. He still loves his brother and he can't kill him for what he has done. He is a real warrior, but a bad politician. He choose his crone above his love for Mare.</p>\n<p>Evangeline Samos: a silver blood with the powers of metal. She is married to Cal, but she is in love with Elane. Her brother is the only member of the family she likes. She would do everything to protect him.</p>\n<p>Maven Calore: is a silver and has the same powers as Cal, but he's not a warrior like his brother. Maven is good at talking and he always tricks people. He has a kind of obsession for Mare and he is completely out of his mind, because his mother controlled (with her powers) his mind after and before she died. He is in war with his brother about who is the true king of Norta.</p>\n<p>Iris: she is a princes of the Lakelands. She and her mother are planning an invasion to rule Norta. But in the same time Iris is married to Maven, then the king of Norta. She met Mare in her time as prisoner and knows where she's dealing with.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Mare, the Scarlet Guard and Montfort are the alliance of Cal. They are in a fight with Maven for the kingdom of Norta. Maven has an alliance with the Lakelands because he's married to Iris. The Silvers always ruled the kingdom, but the Scarlet Guard wants that that's going to change. When Cal finally beat Maven and got his crown, the Scarlet Guard asked him to give it up to help the red blooded people. He said that he's not going to give up his crown and then the Scarlet Guard leaves to Montfort with Maven as prisoner. In that time the Lakelands were planning a invasion that Cal can't win on his one. He gets a little help from the other Silvers in Norta, but it's still not enough. When the Lakelands attack the Scarlet Guard comes in too. They help Cal and when it's over, he will give up his crown. Maven escaped in the battle. So when Mare goes after him, she killed him after a fight she almost lost. The Scarlet Guard are the ones that beat the Lakelands and Cal gives up his crown. The final battle is played and the Scarlet Guard won.</p>\n<p>In my opinion it's a fantastic book. It's the last part of a series I have read long before. And to be honest I think it went as it should be. It's written very well with the people ending as I hoped they should end. I'm kind of sad that this was the last book, because it is one of my favorite series. The story was never bored, but it was hard to came through it because it was very big. I also liked it that it was told out of other perspectives, because so you know what the other people think too. And what they are doing. At all I liked the book very much and I would love to read it in Dutch again!</p>\n"

And a year after that they are world famous as \"The four Horseman\". At their show at Las Vegas, they rob a bank in Paris and let all the money fall out of the sky at the audience. They gave the money to people how had a hard time. Because they lost a lot of money.  But if the next day the Paris' bank really is robed, they get a lot of attention of the FBI. The magicians can't get arrested, because it was a trick. The only thing that the FBI hears is \"How closer you look, the less you see\". And they do it all for the mysteriously Eye, that brought them together for one mission.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I think this was an amazing movie. The story was perfect and they showed a lot. And that came back in what they said: \"How closer you look, the less you see\". The actors were amazing, you see them in the beginning as a solo and only that was fantastic. But if you see them together with the shows and as a group, that's just impressive. You can't let the story go, because you want to know how it's possible and why they do it. And often they show you and that keeps it interesting. It was fun, crazy, mysterious and so much more. In the end, the only thing you can think is: \"Wow, I didn't see that coming!\".</p>\n"

There is a lot of difference between the parts. From a rainforest to one of the driest dessert. The first episode is about South-Africa. The first thing they showed me was a strange part of a dessert. In the dessert is was hot and dry and in the sand there were holes everywhere. It was difficult to survive there for animal.</p>\n<p>I also learned that that the Atlantic Ocean is a cold ocean and the Indian Ocean is the warm ocean. When they meet each other, there will be an abundance of life. The dolphins hunt after the tunas and because of that there come sharks and other huge sea animals.</p>\n<p>On land are elephants, giraffes, hippos, flamingos, lions and much other animals.

I think because I go to South-Africa this holiday. I really look up to that. We go from Cape Town to Johannesburg and a nature park. I hope I see much of the animals in real life.</p>\n"

Noah Calhoun is going to read her a story about their meeting and being together in the old days. Allie is a rich city girl and she falls completely for the peasant Noah. It all happens in one summer, but Allie's parents don't really agree with the love between them. Allie and Noah get into an argument about that and in that conversation things go completely wrong. One day later Allie has to leave with her parents and she doesn't get the chance to make it up to Noah. When Noah knows she is gone, he starts sending letters for a year. He never gets an answer... There was a war and Noah had to join the army. Allie was in her third year of college when she became a nurse for soldiers. There she meets a soldier who asked her out. Later when he's fully recovered, she goes out with him. When the man, with the approval of her parents, asks her to marry her, she says yes. But then she sees Noah in the newspaper with the renovated house she planned living in together, she starts to have doubts. She goes back to the place where they were that summer and notices that she is still completely in love with Noah. So she has to choose between the approval of her parents or her real love. At that moment in the story Allie gets her memory back. Noah and she dance for a few minutes before Allie forgets him again. Allie chooses Noah and they have children and grandchildren (who Allie can't remember eigher). Allie gets one last clear moment when she asks Noah if their love could make miracles. Eventually they die in each other's arms at the same time during their sleep.</p>\n<p>This was a beautiful, sad, compelling and impressive film. Fantastic... I don't have good words for it, but you just have to watch this once and realize how bad it is not knowing who you are anymore. Just unbelievable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"

One of them is the wildlife. A lot of bears where attracted by the garbage, because of the food. After a few accidents where people met the bears, the people thought of solutions to keep the bears away. They made new garbage containers, how bears weren't able to open. Another problem is that the town was in the middle of a crossway for a lot of animals, the town was a wildlife corridor. To connect the parts of land with each other they made wildlife crossings and that helped a lot for the wildlife. Now they had a big genetic pool again. Because the town was getting bigger, their came so much more people. To protect the people, who were walking or cycling, from the wildlife they hang cameras and then they could tell the people which paths they should avoid. So the bears and wolfs didn't get annoyed while they were eating. Also the children in the town learned about the wildlife in the area with 'wild smart'.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I liked this documentary because it was very nice to see that it's possible to live among wild animal. There are a lot of things to do to make it safe and good for both parts, but it is possible. I think that the people in the town had a great mindset to make it work and they can be very proud about what they have achieved.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"

First, it makes us less vulnerable. So when the Earth is gone, we are able to live at Mars. Second, exploration is in our DNA. We \"began\" at Africa and now we're all over the world.</p>\n<p>Mars is a lot smaller than the Earth, but we will have the same space as the Earth. The Earth has lots of water and Mars is more land. We wouldn't be able to breathe either, Mars is not breathable. The air constraint 96% CO2. It is there very cold and it is faraway, like 8 months traveling. There is less gravity and daylength is almost the same.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk thinks the first human will lend on Mars in 2027. NASA thinks that we will actually live on Mars at 2050. But for living there we need several things, like food, water, shelter, clothing and oxygen. They say we have access to all this things with the technology nowadays. They say we can bring food, there is water at Mars, they created a suit that would prevent that we would fall apart and they made a machine that is able to created oxygen. So we have everything we need. And when we heat up Mars by creating a bigger atmosphere, we would be able to make our own food.</p>\n<p>So not if, but when we live at Mars we will never be the last of our kind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This was really interesting. I think that what they said it true, we will live at Mars very soon. It is so amazing what human are capable of. We build and build everywhere. I'm a bit concerned about living at Mars either. We almost destroyed the Earth, so why wouldn't we destroy Mars? I hope that we learned our lessons and make Mars a better version of the Earth.</p>\n"

There were a couple of questions why.</p>\n<p>Why to Mars? Now if there is any past or present life on Mars it will help us now more about the biochemistry. That will help us defeat diseases we don't know about, yet. And we can learn more about what happened on Mars. Because early Mars had a think atmosphere, water in rivers and oceans. Mars was very Earth like, but today Mars has inhospitably, no surfaces water and a thin atmosphere.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why humans? Robots did a lot of us, but there are very difficult too. Robots need to be for programmed and to do that we need to know much about the environment of Mars, but we don't or not enough. And humans have a lot of benefits. We have intelligence, ingenuity, adaptability, agility, dexterity, mobility, speed and efficiency. This makes us very useful for exploring the apart of Mars that robots can't.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why become a two planet specie?</p>\n<p>There are several threats on Earth for humans. And if you think about it, first the dinosaurs were the mean living species on Earth, but with one cosmic impact they were gone. So why would that happen with us?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To live on Mars we need to terraform it. We need to melt the water and CO2. Let plants grow for oxygen and form a ozone layer for protection. And make oceans, so Mars will be Earth like again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I think this it something beautiful. We are capable of so many things, it is unbelievable.
