They form an organ system called the reproductive system. Now we are going to learn about the sex cells.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"font-style-italic\">The female sex cell</h2>\n<p>In females, the ovaries contain small, undeveloped egg cells. Once every 28-32 days, an egg cell from one ovary becomes mature. It is released into the oviduct (sometimes called the Fallopian tube).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/a/a591b01f08d5a8b33ea523c807abc20ced51dafd.png\" class=\"height-256-pixels width-400-pixels\"/></p>\n<p>Figure 1, Ovulation is the release of an egg cell and happens every 28-32 days.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The oviduct is lined with cilia that sweep the egg cell towards the uterus. The uterus is where the baby will develop. It has strong, muscular walls and a soft lining.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/1/18857a62717db6e849ebac5e0e89e826d7c2ac1d.png\" class=\"height-300-pixels width-400-pixels\"/></p>\n<p>Figure 2, A human egg cell with labeled parts. A sperm cell is shown for scale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The egg cell is perfectly built for its job. It needs to recieve the human sperm cell and make sure only one enters. For this purpose it has a jelly coat arounds its cell membrane. The jelly coat hardens after a single sperm cell has entered. This way no more than one sperm is able to enter. Also it is very big compared to the sperm, it has a lot of cytoplasm. This way the egg cell can devide a couple of times on the way to the uterus wall, speeding up the development of the embryo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"font-style-italic\">The male sex cell</h2>\n<p>Males make sperm cells in their testes. The testes are held outside the body in a bag of skin called the scrotum. Their position helps to keep the sperm cells at the right temperature to develop properly.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/8/81079afa15fe1ddecbde7bef5864719ca6895938.png\" class=\"height-315-pixels width-490-pixels\"/></p>\n<p>Figure 3, The path human semen takes from the testis to the penis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When sperm cells are released from the testes they travel up the sperm ducts, where special fluids are added from glands. The fluids give the sperm cells energy. Together the sperm cells and the fluids are called semen The semen leaves through the urethra. This tube also carries urine from the bladder, but never at the same time as semen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/f/f96c8f48dbdac42911b296884d9b6ffb0f459f43.png\" class=\"height-211-pixels width-350-pixels\"/></p>\n<p>Figure 4, A human sperm cell with labeled parts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A human sperm cell might look simple, but it actually is build perfectly for its job! It's job is to deliver genetic material to the female egg cell. The tail allows it to swim. There is very little cytoplasm so that the cell can have a thin streamlined shape. The nucleus contains half the genetic material needed to make a human being. The tip of the head (acrosome) contains chemicals that attack the jelly coat of the egg cell. This allows the sperm cell to burrow inside.</p>\n"
