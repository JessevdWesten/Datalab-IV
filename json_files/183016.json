It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. Since president John Adams (1800), it has been where the President has lived.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are 132 rooms in the White House: 35 bathrooms, 147 windows, 412 doors, 28 fireplaces, 8 staircases, and 3 elevators.</p>\n<p>The White House was designed by James Hoban, and looks a bit like buildings from Ancient Greece. It was built between 1792 and 1800, and was changed by presidents as they came and went. Thomas Jefferson added a long series of columns called colonnades, and these were used for the stables as well as storage.</p>\n<p>T<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/4/4cfb3595d9aef6e9219648ef7174ae1d997011ba.jpg\" class=\"height-164-pixels width-397-pixels float-right\"/>he British Army set the  Whitehouse on fire in 1814  during the <strong>War of 1812</strong>, a war  between Britain and America.  Most of the inside was  destroyed and the outside was charred. Reconstruction of the White House began shortly after the war, with James Monroe being the first president to live in the new White House in 1817, though it was only partially made at the time.</p>\n<p>President Theodore Roosevelt constructed the now famous <strong>West Wing</strong> in 1901. The White House was too small. It was expanded even further by President William Taft, who created the first <strong>Oval Office</strong>, which was the main office of the president. This eventually was moved due to the need to have the section expanded.</p>\n<p>In 1927, the attic that was located on the third floor was turned into living quarters. Along with this, the <strong>East Wing</strong> was made, and was used to welcome people before social events.</p>\n<p>Additional office space was made in 1946 in the East Wing, however in 1948 it was shown that the wood beams and structure of the White House was falling apart and close to failure. President Harry Truman removed all the interior rooms to create a new, stable steel frame inside all the walls. Once completed, the rooms were all reconstructed.</p>\n<p>The White House is one of the most iconic symbols of America. It is one of the most popular destinations for tourists, and the structure is incredibly large. There are White House tours and many other activities to do in and around The White House, and it will house the President of the United States for the foreseeable future.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n"
