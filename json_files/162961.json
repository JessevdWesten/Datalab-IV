Floyd died after policeman Derek Chauvin leaned on Floyd's neck with his knee for more than eight minutes, while it was cuffed with his belly on the street. After Floyd became unconscious after six minutes, Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck for almost another three minutes. Floyd was then transported in an ambulance to the hospital, where he was declared dead.</p>\n<p><br/>\nFloyd's death was recorded by bystanders, and broadcast live on Facebook Live. This caught the attention of the American media and was the direct cause of the protests after the death of George Floyd that were held the following days in Minneapolis and other cities worldwide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While Floyd was held by the policeman, he mentioned the words: \"I can't breath\". These words are used by demonstrators and together with the words 'black lives matter' form the slogan for the protests.</p>\n"

From Columbus' arrival in 1492 to the declaration of independence in 1776.</p>\n<p>When we discuss this history, the influence white men had is always mentioned. Of course, we're about to speak about slavery, but then we mainly focus on the unfair situation and oppression these people faced.</p>\n<p>After a civil war between the North and South, the U.S. abolished slavery in 1865. From that moment on, the white population was equal to the black population. Isn't it?</p>\n<p>The worldwide protests against police violence and racism show that many people still feel that there is a distinction between different ethnic groups. In order to get a better picture of this problem, it is important to understand its history.</p>\n<p>Since the abolition of slavery, many people have fought for more equality between white and black people. Immerse yourself in the perspectives of these people and what they stood for. Do you agree with their ideas? What message do you want to convey on this subject? How serious is the situation?</p>\n<p>You will answer these questions by writing a rap.</p>\n"

In 2010 a remake was made to raise money for the earthquake in Haiti.</p>\n<p>In the Netherlands, too, there have been songwriters who drew attention to problems such as racism. In 1984 Frank Boeien Groep made the song Black and White. This song is also a remake, made by Ali B.</p>\n<p>Listen to the songs.
