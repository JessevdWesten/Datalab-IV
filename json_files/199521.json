Many stars you may see tonight are identical to the sun. They are just millions of times further away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sun is a huge sphere of gas held together by gravity. The interior of the sun (the core) is extremely hot. The sun radiates that energy on the outside (photosphere). With the amount of energy that the sun radiates in one second, we would have enough for 500,000 years to meet our energy needs on earth. Unfortunately, most of it disappears into space...</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Corona</strong><br/>\nThe stretched atmosphere around the sun is called the corona. During a solar eclipse, the corona is beautifully visible for a short time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Solar Flares</strong><br/>\nA solar flare is an explosion on the surface of the sun. This explosion is caused by the sudden release of a large amount of energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Mantle</strong><br/>\nThe part around the core is called the mantle. The mantle becomes less and less dense towards the outside and also less and less hot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Photosphere</strong><br/>\nThe visible exterior of the sun is called the photosphere. The photosphere is the layer where the light visible to us comes from.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Core</strong><br/>\nThe inner part of the sun is called the core. The core has a diameter of 200,000 km. Here the temperature is the highest, over 15 million degrees.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Convection Zone</strong><br/>\nThe convection zone is the region between the mantle and the photosphere. From this region, hot bubbles of gas rise toward the outer edge of the sun.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n"
