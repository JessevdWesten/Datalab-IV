    "title": "Role-Play Cards Version C",
    "description": "This is version C of Let\u2019s Grow\u2019s speaking cards. Version C only contains speaking cards with role C. Your fellow role play partners should open version A, B or D to find their designated role descriptions. \r\n\r\nEvery segment in this version contains one speaking card. At the top you find the name of the role play. The first role play is called \u201cBehind my back4P\u201d. Your role play partners should always use the same role play in any of the different versions. \r\n\r\n\u201cBehind my back4P\u201d has four versions. This means the required number of role players for \u201cBehind my back4P\u201d is four. You can find out the required number of role players by looking at the superscripted 2P,3P or 4P next to the role play name. Version C and D don\u2019t contain the role play cards with two versions. They can only be found in version A and B. Always read your role play card carefully before acting out the role play. You can keep the role play card close to peek during the improvisation. ",
