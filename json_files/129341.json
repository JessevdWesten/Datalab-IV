You will find that quite common. However, there are many things involved to make this possible. This is what this module is about: winning, save, distribute, purify and improve our drinking water, and also about the use and value of drinking water.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Where does our drinking water come from and how do we deal with it?</p>\n<p>In this module you will work on learning objectives of the learning areas:social sciences, science and technology, arithmetic, math and English.</p>\n<p><strong>Method:</strong> you answer the questions in this module individually. The interim products and the final product you will make with a group. For some answers you have to search on the internet. As a result, you will work on the 21st century skills: teamwork, critical thinking, Information skills and media literacy. At the unit end products and the final assignment we also require creativity of you.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning units</strong><br/>\nThe module consists of 5 learning units and a final assignment.<br/>\nThe time per learning unit is approximately:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" class=\"width-500-pixels\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Where does drinking water come from?</td>\n<td class=\"text-align-right\">3 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Does water only consist of water?</td>\n<td class=\"text-align-right\">2,5 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Use of drinking water</td>\n<td class=\"text-align-right\">2,5 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Water and technology</td>\n<td class=\"text-align-right\">2 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The value of water</td>\n<td class=\"text-align-right\">3 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Final assignment</td>\n<td class=\"text-align-right\">7 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the learning object <strong>Planning</strong> you will make a planning in which you indicate when you are going to spend this time and with whom you work together.</p>\n<p>At the end of the module in the learning object <strong>Evaluation</strong> you look back on the module.<br/>\nAs a result, you will work on the learning strategies: planning and evaluation.</p>\n"

The most rain water comes right back in the sea. The rest falls on the country and disappears in the ground or through rivers and canals to the sea.

Groundwater is rain water that has sunk deep-between 40 and 300 meter- in the ground. It is naturally filtered, but it should still be treated before it is suitable as drinking water. </p>\n<p>The amount of water available in England and Wales to meet the needs of people and to sustain the water environment varies greatly between different places and seasons, and from one year to another. Parts of Wales and the English Lake District are well endowed with water, while water is scarce in parts of Eastern and Southeastern England. Parts of England were affected by severe drought in 1976, 1995 and 2005-2007.</p>\n<p>Surface water is dirtier than groundwater. Therefore, the cleaning process is more extensive and more expensive, and that makes the drinking water from surface water more expensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Key words: groundwater extraction, surface water, infiltration</strong></p>\n"

If the Earth would be completely flat, then it would be one Sea, 3,700 meters deep. An inexhaustible source, so it seems. But 97% of the 1.4 billion cubic kilometres of water is sea water, and more than 2% is ice. What remains is either at great depths, or is highly polluted. This means that only 0.003% would be immediately suitable to be used for the supply of drinking water.<br />\n<br />\nIt seems logical that this raw material should be estimated to its value, protected and safeguarded for future generations. Yet this is not done sufficiently. Water is still being wasted, polluted and ' abused '. This causes an impending global water scarcity. Recent forecasts suggest that by 2025 more than fifty countries, with three billion people will face water scarcity, caused by an increase in the demand for water with 650%.<br />\n<br />\nWe live today thanks to the presence of water. All life on our planet, after all, has emerged from the water. The importance of this natural raw material is still increasing: the presence of (potable) water determines the social and cultural structure and the level of development of a country. Often, water is a power tool, a weapon that determines economic strength and political relations within a group of countries, a region or a continent.<br />\nIf we continue to follow the current tendency, in the future we will no longer have access to sufficient drinking water.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create (in pairs) a poster in which you explain 5 causes of water scarcity and prepare a presentation of the poster.</li>\n<li>You agree with your teacher when you two will present the poster.</li>\n<li>Your poster and presentation are judged on content, language and presentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The assessment of language and presentation is developed further in this <strong><a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/7/7813e31d8e195912dce37ceca0627216350c0ce6.doc\">form</a></strong>.<br />\n </p>\n<p> </p>"

Some water companies still use chlorine in the treatment of surface water, but only in very small quantities.

After all, chlorine kills germs. It has also contributed to the reliability of drinking water produced from surface water. The use of chlorine, however, is strongly declining. Some water companies still use chlorine in the treatment of surface water, but only in very small quantities. In case of bacterial contamination in the water mains, which can occur suddenly due to a pipe rupture, chlorine is temporarily required to kill any pathogenic bacteria. In that case it is added in very small doses, which are absolutely not harmful to health.</p>"

UK legislation stipulates that the water companies must supply reliable drinking water. The water must therefore have no properties that can be bad for health. Among other things, fluorine, lead, chlorine and nitrate are substances that are not allowed to be in the drinking water or to a very limited extent. There is therefore no reason to drink water other than tap water. Some manufacturers of mineral waters sometimes claim that many or no minerals are good for the body. Minerals play an important role in specific body functions, but too many minerals are not good for the kidneys.</p>"

For example, surface water is often contaminated as a result of discharges of chemical waste and the use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture. Disinfectants and chemicals are required in order to this water clean. A waste product of this cleaning process is polluted sludge. This sludge must be processed or stored. Furthermore it's true that we consume more and more water. So it's costing also more and more money and energy to produce water. Finally, the extraction of groundwater also contributes to the decrease of the level of groundwater and thereby to dryness of nature. For all these reasons, it is important to use water in an economical way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What is the normal level of groundwater in your hometown?</p>"

It is true that only in the last century we have made considerable progress. Yet one tries for centuries, in various ways, to store and distribute water.</p>\n<p>The first primitive people were highly dependent on the natural conditions. They were going to live there where water was to be found. They settled on the edge of a river or in the vicinity of a natural spring. They discovered how water could be controlled.</p>\n<p>About 7000 years ago, people discovered that one can find water by digging wells. Water was collected in water wells in Jericho and used as source for water. Wells of which the walls were lined with bamboo twigs, were found in Egypt. The water was picked up with buckets and leather pouches (shadoef). Already in that time, people started the building of waterlines through caving ditches from the rocks, or by digging trenches in the sand. Later the Egyptians used hollow palm trees for the construction of water conducts. In China, Java and Japan the made conduct out of bamboo.</p>\n<p> The first kilometre-long supply pipe was in built in Pergamon, about 200 years before Christ. In ancient Greece they even built bridges to be able to cross valleys. The Greeks were therefore the first to supply water under high pressure using the principle of communicating vessels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/8/81fc15f291765280e678f452d2487391f7f93be3.png\" class=\"height-130-pixels width-200-pixels float-right\"/>It was not until the Roman Empire that the water supply experienced a large growth. The basis for our current supply system was formed in this period. The sources for water were equipped in such a way that there was a maximum protection against contamination from outside. For example: the top of the gutter where the water flowed was covered with stones. It's mainly the aqueducts which still appeal to our imagination. Fourteen aqueducts carried water to Rome from where it was distributed over the different districts. Especially the rich, the thermal baths and the public fountains made use of this water supply system.<br/>\nApart from aqueducts, the Romans built also large pumps that that could pump water up.<br/>\n                                <br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/5/5d1eb59e528bbbbc9dd7e535669c3621efe9fec6.png\" class=\"height-297-pixels width-450-pixels\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/5/5c0199207ac1457e1dd1a4494b79d82260bcffec.png\" class=\"height-115-pixels width-200-pixels float-right\"/>After the collapse of the Roman Empire the aqueducts carried no more water for a long time. This caused the loss of the technical knowledge. The residents even had to hire carriers to bring water. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater, in the middle-ages, nobody constructed water networks that could be compared to the Roman buildings. People were satisfied with getting water from wells, both in the city and beyond. Nevertheless the hygiene in this public wells was so bad, that regular epidemics such as the plague broke out. The wells were very simple in construction: the pick-up system consisted of a rope and a pulley. Because all the houses were built of wood, the risk of fire was very large. The well water was mainly used to fight fires and less as drinking water. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to encounter the pollution of drinking water, the wells were later covered and equipped with hand pumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil the early twentieth century people brought their drinking water with a bucket from a stream or canal or from a well, also in our country. If they drank water, they got often an infectious disease such as typhoid fever or cholera. Because waste water and human waste were often discharged in the same stream or canal where the drinking water came from.<br/>\n<br/>\nImprovement was very slow, with little effective progress made until the growth of modern densely populated cities in the 1800s. During this period, public health authorities began pressing for better waste disposal systems to be installed, to prevent or control epidemics of disease.. Only after 1945 most people in rural areas were connected to the water piping system as well.<br/>\nWater companies were founded to ensure - still today - that water is suitable for consumption. The water is carried to the users by an extensive piping system. A sewage system ensures that the waste water is drained.</p>\n"

Nevertheless, the standard for the allowable amount of lead in drinking water in the EC drinking water directive (EC = European Community) is tightened up. The UK legislation has been adapted to this tightening. One aims to replace all lead pipes in the UK. And there are quite a few, because before 1970 many smaller water pipes were made from lead.</p>\n<p><br />\nWhy is lead bad for your health?</p>"

The water level in these reservoirs is monitored through automatic level measurements. As soon as the level in the clean water cellars has become too low, the water production is increased. When the water level has regained, the extra supply to the clean water cellars will stop. The water from these cellars is pumped in the distribution network by high pressure pumps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>High pressure pump</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/7/726f16cd0afe996dd9cde19d9ccc48366d0bf0b8.png\" class=\"height-214-pixels width-600-pixels\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br/>\nTransport the purified drinking water to the customer and provide a constant pressure to the available water.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Principle</strong><br/>\nThrough the use of high pressure pumps one can pump water from the clean water cellars to the water towers or directly in the distribution network.</p>\n<p><strong>Operation</strong><br/>\nThe pumps send water under high pressure to the distribution pipes. They supply both the users directly and the water towers. The control of the high pressure pumps is based on the measured water pressure in the circuit and/or by the water level in water towers.</p>\n<h3>Water tower</h3>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/2/2b28c7159b9dc4ef8f2b143fc882fb6b61937cca.png\" class=\"height-342-pixels width-328-pixels float-right\"/>Purpose</strong><br/>\nEnsure the supply of purified water close to the user and absorbing pressure surges and peak consumption. The water tower is thus both a flow rate and a pressure regulator.</p>\n<p><br/>\n<strong>Principle</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>Flow rate regulator</strong></em><br/>\nThe water is pumped to the users and the water tower by high-pressure pumps. These pumps have a pretty constant flow rate. If the consumption of the customers is lower than the flow rate provided by the pumps, then the surplus is stored in the water tower. If the consumption is higher, then the deficit is complemented by the reserves from the water tower.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>Pressure regulator</strong></em><br/>\nThe difference in height between the water level in the tub and the water in the distribution pipes, creates a natural pressure due to gravity and the system of the \"communicating vessels\".</p>\n<p><strong>Operation</strong><br/>\nA water tower is not more than a reservoir or container that rests on a support. The tub usually has a double wall and the top is covered. In this way the temperature can be kept constant and the water is protected from pollution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn principle, a water tower has just two pipes. The tub is filled from above by the input pipe. At the end is a valve that automatically shuts down as the float indicates that the tub is full. Through a grid in the bottom of the tub, the water is directed into the distribution pipe, after which it distributed to the customers. This is done by the natural law of gravity, without the aid of pumps or other installations. The supply and distribution can happen through the same pipe, or through two different. Important is that the supply and drainage are positioned in such a that the water in the tub is refreshed frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, there is always an overflow at the top of the tub. Should there be a problem with the automatic valve, then the water can still flow away. This overflow is connected to the sewer by means of the overflow pipe. This tube is also required to empty the tub, for example, during maintenance work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>How does one know how much water the tub contains?</strong><br/>\nThe water towers are equipped with an automatic level measurement system that allows the amount of water in the tub can be measured. This measurement can be done in different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost recent method is the ultrasonic level measurement. A device that hangs above the tub and sends pulses (inaudible to the human ear), that are reflected by the surface of the water. These echoes are captured by a sensor and the water level of the Tower is calculated on the basis of the time difference between emitting and receiving the signals. This level data can be requested either via a direct phone line, or stand in direct connection with a computer that manages the filling of the tub.<br/>\n<br/>\nfollows. On the water drives a float which is connected through a cable to a mechanism of indication on a measurement bar down in the water tower. In a number of water towers one works also with detectors that are placed on certain distances in the tub. These detectors send the signal whether they are still in contact with water or not..</p>\n<p>Another method is to place a clock at the bottom of the tub that measures the pressure of the water and calculates how much water is left in the cockpit accordingly. However, these level measurement methods are systematically replaced by the ultrasonic level measurement system.</p>\n"

So even if you are just a little bit dehydrated, you can already get a headache.</li>\r\n\t<li>Fatigue / poor concentration: if the body needs all its strength to remove the excess of toxins as a result of insufficient drinking, you will have less energy.</li>\r\n\t<li>Constipation: water speeds up and relaxes the relief process. By drinking enough you get a regular bowel movement.</li>\r\n\t<li>Little or dark urine: the kidneys filter waste products from the blood. This requires water. Otherwise, urine production will decrease and the concentration of waste products will increase. You immediately see this on the dark color of the urine.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bad breath: If not enough water flows through the mouth to wash away all food remains, bacteria accumulate in the mouth and pharynx. The tongue becomes white, and bad breath is the result.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dry mouth: saliva is the natural lubrication of the mouth. If you drink too little, the body makes less saliva and you get a dry mouth.</li>\r\n\t<li>Dry skin: If you drink too little, the skin becomes less elastic. You can check this by pulling up the skin on the back of your hand. If you let go of the skin, the skin must immediately shoot back.</li>\r\n\t<li>Inflated appearance: the less you drink, the more the body stores water as a reserve supply.

The body can give out different signals if you drink too little:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Headache: water removes toxins from the body. The brain consists of 75% water. So even if you are just a little bit dehydrated, you can already get a headache.</li>\n<li>Fatigue / poor concentration: if the body needs all its strength to remove the excess of toxins as a result of insufficient drinking, you will have less energy.</li>\n<li>Constipation: water speeds up and relaxes the relief process. By drinking enough you get a regular bowel movement.</li>\n<li>Little or dark urine: the kidneys filter waste products from the blood. This requires water. Otherwise, urine production will decrease and the concentration of waste products will increase. You immediately see this on the dark color of the urine.</li>\n<li>Bad breath: If not enough water flows through the mouth to wash away all food remains, bacteria accumulate in the mouth and pharynx. The tongue becomes white, and bad breath is the result.</li>\n<li>Dry mouth: saliva is the natural lubrication of the mouth. If you drink too little, the body makes less saliva and you get a dry mouth.</li>\n<li>Dry skin: If you drink too little, the skin becomes less elastic. You can check this by pulling up the skin on the back of your hand. If you let go of the skin, the skin must immediately shoot back.</li>\n<li>Inflated appearance: the less you drink, the more the body stores water as a reserve supply. As a result, the cells swell and you look 'too fat'.</li>\n</ul>"

The following minerals are found in our tap water:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sodium</strong> is important for managing the water balance, the functioning of muscles and nerves - and transports the food.</li>\n<li><strong>hloride</strong> with sodium and potassium is responsible for maintaining the equilibrium of the water balance. It is an ingredient of gastric juices for digestion.</li>\n<li><strong>otassium</strong> along with sodium and chloride regulates the water balance and the functioning of muscles and nerves.</li>\n<li><strong>alcium</strong> is essential for building and maintenance of bones and teeth. Calcium is also important in blood clotting, the functioning of nerves and muscles and transport of substances (sodium, potassium and magnesium) in and out the body cells.</li>\n<li><strong>hosphorus</strong> is also an important constituent of bones and teeth and also needed for the construction of enzymes. It helps in energy generation and is a building block of cell nucleus acids.</li>\n<li><strong>agnesium</strong> is needed for bone growth and plays an important role in the construction of body protein and the transmission of nerve impulses.</li>\n<li><strong>ron</strong> contributes to the formation of red blood cells and is responsible for the collection and release of oxygen in the blood.</li>\n<li><strong>inc</strong> is a component of many enzymes in the body. It has an important function at renewal of tissue and the functioning of the immune system.</li>\n<li>\u2022<strong>odine</strong> is a building block of the thyroid hormones.
