St. Andrew, one of Christ's twelve apostles, is the patron saint of Scotland. Some of his bones are said to have been brought to what is now St. Andrews in Fife during the 4th century. Since medieval times the X-shaped saltire cross upon which St. Andrew was supposedly crucified has been the Scottish national symbol.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>England's national day is St. George's Day (23 April). St. George is the patron saint of England. A story that first appeared in the 6th century tells that St. George rescued a hapless maid by slaying a fearsome fire-breathing dragon! The saint's name was shouted as a battle cry by English knights who fought beneath the red-cross banner of St. George during the Hundred Years War (1338-1453). This is<br/>\n<br/>\nSt. David's Day (1 March) is the national day of Wales. St. David (c.520-588), the patron saint of Wales, was the founder and first abbot-bishop of Menevia, now St. David's in Dyfed, South Wales. The day is commemorated by the wearing of daffodils or leeks by patriotic Welsh people. Both plants are traditionally regarded as the national emblems of Wales.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.tolearnenglish.com/free/civi/Education_fichiers/Leeks.jpeg\" class=\"height-120-pixels width-85-pixels float-right\"/><br/>\nimmortalised in Shakespeare's play Henry V in the lines:</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.tolearnenglish.com/free/civi/Education_fichiers/spacer.gif\" class=\"height-10-pixels width-10-pixels\"/></td>\n<td><em>\"I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,<br/>\nStraining upon the start.

The work of St. Patrick (c.389-c.461) was a vital factor in the spread of Christianity in Ireland. Born in Britain, he was carried off by pirates, and spent six years in slavery before escaping and training as a missionary. The day is marked by the wearing of shamrocks (a clover-like plant), the national badge of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  </p>\n"

Preparations start well in advance, with the sending of Christmas cards and installation of a decorated Christmas tree in a prominent place in the home. Although it is now a firmly established tradition, the Christmas tree was first popularised by Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, who introduced the custom from his native Germany in 1840.</p>\n<p>Some houses are decorated with evergreens (plants which do not lose their leaves in winter); a wreath of holly on the front door and garlands of holly, ivy and fir indoors. Bunches of mistletoe are often hung above doorways - any couple passing underneath must exchange kisses! Traditional food is prepared: sweet mince pies, a rich Christmas cake and the Christmas pudding. Everyone has their own favourite recipe, but they're all packed full of spices, nuts, dried fruit and brandy.<br/>\nPresents are bought and wrapped, and traditionally placed under the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve. Christmas is both a secular and a religious holiday, and many families like to attend a midnight service at church on Christmas Eve, or celebrate Christmas in church on Christmas morning.</p>\n<p>The excitement begins for children on Christmas Eve, when they hang up their stockings (an old sock or, more ambitiously, pillow cases) around the fireplace or at the foot of the bed for Father Christmas to fill with presents. The English Father Christmas or Santa Claus is first recorded in his traditional red and white outfit in a woodcut of 1653, but the story of Santa arriving in his reindeer-drawn sleigh and descending down the chimney to fill children's stockings with presents derives from the USA.</p>\n<p>Practically everyone sits down to a Christmas dinner in the early afternoon of Christmas Day, traditionally roast turkey, but some families prefer goose or roast beef. The turkey is followed by the Christmas pudding, brought to the table flaming hot. Brandy is poured over the pudding, then lit. The day ends with everyone relaxing, watching television or playing guessing-games like charades.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Boxing Day</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nBoxing Day (26 December) is so-called because it's a time when tradespeople receive a 'Christmas Box' - some money in appreciation of the work they've carried out all year. Traditionally a time for visiting family and friends and indulging in more feasting, Boxing Day is a popular day for football matches and other sporting fixtures. The day is a public holiday, so shops and banks are closed. More recently, some shops have broken with tradition and now open on Boxing Day to encourage shoppers who can't wait to spend their Christmas money!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>New Year</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nNew Year is often launched with a party - either at home with family and friends or a gathering in the local pubs and clubs. Merrymaking begins on New Year's Eve and builds up to midnight. The stroke of midnight is the cue for much cheering, hooting, whistling, kissing and the drinking of toasts.<br/>\nTradition has it that the first person over the threshold on New Year's Day will dictate the luck brought to the household in the coming year. This is known as First Footing. At midnight on 31 December, particularly in Scotland and northern England, 'first footers' (traditionally a tall, dark, good-looking man) step over the threshold bringing the New Year's Luck. The first footer usually brings a piece of coal, a loaf and a bottle of whisky. On entering he must place the fuel on the fire, put the loaf on the table and pour a glass for the head of the house, all normally without speaking or being spoken to until he wishes everyone 'A Happy New Year'. He must, of course, enter by the front door and leave by the back.</p>\n<p>In Wales the back door is opened to release the Old Year at the first stroke of midnight. It is then locked up to 'keep the luck in' and at the last stroke the New Year is let in at the front door.<br/>\nIn Scotland the New Year remains the greatest of all annual festivals. Called 'Hogmanay' (a word whose meaning has never been satisfactorily established), it's marked by an evening of drinking and merrymaking, culminating at the stroke of midnight when huge gatherings of people at Edinburgh's Tron Kirk and Glasgow's George Square greet the New Year by linking arms and singing 'Auld Lang Syne'.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Halloween</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.tolearnenglish.com/free/civi/Education_fichiers/pumpkin.gif\" class=\"height-82-pixels width-85-pixels float-right\"/>Halloween (31 October) and its associations with witches and ghosts derives from the Celtic Old Year's Night - the night of all witches, when spirits were said to walk the earth. Witches and supernatural beings are still remembered all over Britain, when bands of children roam the streets in ghoulish costumes, carrying Halloween lanterns - pumpkins hollowed out with a ghostly face cut into one side, which glows when a candle is placed inside.</p>\n<p>In recent years the custom of 'trick or treating' has gained in popularity. Although we commonly associate this practice with America, the custom originated in England as 'Mischief Night' when children declared one 'lawless night' of unpunished pranks (usually May Day eve or Halloween).</p>\n<p>Halloween parties (usually for children) include games such as apple bobbing, where apples are either floated in water or hung by a string. The object of the game is for the players to put their hands behind their back and try to seize an apple with their teeth alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Easter</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEaster day is named after the Saxon goddess of spring, Eostre, whose feast took place at the spring equinox. Easter is now the spring feast of the Christian church, commemorating the resurrection of Jesus. It falls on a Sunday between<br/>\n22 March and 25 April, according to the church calendar.</p>\n<p>Traditionally Easter eggs, dyed and decorated or made of chocolate, are given as presents symbolising new life and the coming of spring.<br/>\nEgg rolling competitions take place in northern Britain on Easter Monday; hard-boiled eggs are rolled down a slope, with the winner being - according to local preference - the one which rolls the furthest, survives the most rolls, or is successfully aimed between two pegs! The best publicised event takes place at Avenham Park in Preston, Lancashire.</p>\n<p>Easter parades are also part of the Easter tradition, with those taking part wearing Easter bonnets or hats, traditionally decorated with spring flowers and ribbons.</p>\n"

They must 'toss' their pancake (flip it over in the frying pan) at least three times during the race. The winner receives a kiss from the Pancake Bell Ringer - church bells were traditionally rung to remind parishioners to come to confession - and a prayer book from the vicar!</p>\n"

The most well-known folk costumes are those of the Morris dancers. They can be seen in many country villages during the summer months performing folk dances that once held ritualistic and magical meanings associated with the awakening of the earth.<br/>\nThe costume varies from team to team, but basically consists of white trousers, a white shirt, a pad of bells worn around the calf of the leg, and a hat made of felt or straw, decorated with ribbons and flowers. The bells and ribbons are said to banish harm and bring fertility. Morris dancing was originally an all-male tradition, but now some teams feature women dancers too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Scotland</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.tolearnenglish.com/free/civi/Education_fichiers/edinburgh.jpeg\" class=\"height-132-pixels width-85-pixels float-right\"/>Perhaps the most famous national costume in Britain is the Scottish kilt with its distinctive tartan pattern. The kilt is a length of woollen cloth, pleated except for sections at each end. The kilt is worn around the waist, with the pleats at the back and the ends crossed over at the front and secured with a pin.<br/>\nEach Scottish Clan or family has its own distinctive tartan pattern, made up of different colours, and an official register of tartans is maintained<br/>\nby the Scottish Tartans Society in Perthshire. Contact:<br/>\nScottish Tartans Society, Port-Na-Craig, Pitlochry, PH16 5ND, Tel +44 (0) 1796 474079 or 1350 728849<br/>\nEmail <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/mailto:research.enquiries@perth.almac.co.uk\">research.enquiries@perth.almac.co.uk</a><br/>\nWebsite <a href=\"http://www.alamc.co.uk/es/sts\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.alamc.co.uk/es/sts</a><br/>\nThe kilt forms part of the traditional Highland dress, worn by Scottish clansmen and Scottish regiments. In addition to the kilt, a plaid or tartan cloak is worn over one shoulder, and a goatskin pouch or sporran is worn at the front of the kilt. Sometimes tartan trousers or trews are worn instead of a kilt. Women do not have their own distinctive national dress in Scotland, although tartan fabrics are widely used in clothing, and the kilt is also worn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Wales</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.tolearnenglish.com/free/civi/Education_fichiers/wales.jpeg\" class=\"height-125-pixels width-85-pixels float-right\"/>The national costume of Wales is based on the peasant costume of the 18th and 19th centuries. Because Wales was isolated geographically from the rest of Britain, many of the individual traits of costume and materials were retained in Welsh dress long after they had died out elsewhere. Unlike Scotland, the distinctive folk costume of Wales was worn by the women, consisting of a long gown (betgwn) or skirt, worn with a petticoat (pais - the favoured colour was scarlet) and topped with a shawl folded diagonally to form a triangle and draped around the shoulders, with one corner hanging down and two others pinned in front. Aprons were universally worn, sometimes simple, sometimes decorated with colourful embroidery.<br/>\nThe most distinctive part of the costume was the tall black<br/>\n'Welsh hat' or 'beaver hat', thought to have originated in France at the end of the 18th century. The hats had a tall crown, cylindrical or conical in shape with a wide brim, and were usually trimmed with a band of silk or cr\u00eape.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Northern Ireland</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEarly Irish dress, based on Gaelic and Norse costumes, consisted of check trews for men, worn with a fringed cloak or mantle, or a short tunic for both men and women, worn with a fringed cloak. This style of dressing was prohibited in the 16th century under sumptuary laws, passed to suppress the distinctive Irish dress and so overcome Irish reluctance to become part of England. In particular, the wearing of the fringed cloak was forbidden, as was the wearing of trews or any saffron-coloured garment (saffron yellow was an important feature of Irish costume).<br/>\nAlthough a strong tradition of wearing folk costume does not survive in Northen Ireland today, folk music and folk dancing are very important.</p>\n"

If you must pass under a ladder you can avoid bad luck by crossing your fingers and keeping them crossed until you've seen a dog. Alternatively, you must lick your finger and make a cross on the toe of your shoe, and not look again at the shoe until the mark has dried.</p>\n<p>Another common superstition is that it is unlucky to open an umbrella in the house - it will either bring misfortune to the person that opened it or to the household. Anyone opening an umbrella in fine weather is unpopular, as it inevitably brings rain!</p>\n<p>The number 13 is said to be unlucky for some, and when the 13th day of the month falls on a Friday, anyone wishing to avoid an inauspicious event had better stay indoors.</p>\n<p>The worst misfortune that can befall you is incurred by breaking a mirror, as it brings seven years of bad luck! The superstition is supposed to have originated in ancient times, when mirrors were considered to be tools of the gods.<br/>\nBlack cats are generally considered lucky in Britain, even though they are associated with witchcraft - a witch's animal-familiar is usually a black cat. It is especially lucky if a black cat crosses your path - although in America the exact opposite belief prevails.<br/>\nFinally, a commonly-held superstition is that of touching wood for luck. This measure is most often taken if you think you have said something that is tempting fate, such as 'my car has never broken down - touch wood!'</p>\n"

It's certainly true that tea is the most popular drink in Britain - far more popular than coffee, which is favoured throughout Europe and America.<br/>\nThe Dutch brought the first tea to Europe in about 1610, but it was not until 1658 that the first advertisement for tea appeared in a London newspaper. By 1750, tea had become the principal drink of all the classes in Britain, yet at that time a pound of the cheapest tea cost about one-third of a skilled worker's weekly wage! Tea was jealously guarded by the lady of the house, and kept in special containers called tea-caddies, often with a lock, and carefully doled out by the teaspoon.</p>\n<p>Gradually, tea-drinking developed into a fashionable social ritual and tea gardens blossomed in places like Vauxhall and Marylebone in London, where couples could stroll in the afternoon and enjoy a cup of tea with bread and butter and cakes. Tea parties were also popular at home, and soon the ritual of 'afternoon tea' was firmly established. Today, throughout the homes, tea-shops and hotels of Britain, the custom of tea-time continues, and it remains a feature of any cricket match or summer f\u00eate. High Tea is a more substantial evening meal, popular in northern England and Scotland.<br/>\nTea in Britain is traditionally brewed in a china teapot, adding one spoonful of tea per person and one for the pot. Great importance is attached to the use of freshly boiled water, which is poured onto the leaves and then the tea is left to 'brew' for a few minutes. Most people in Britain prefer a rich, strong cup of tea with milk, and sugar is sometimes added to taste.</p>\n"

Where else can you appear as a complete stranger and at once be able to join in a conversation with a diverse group of people?

Village pubs with their country furnishings and real ales attract not only local folk but citydwellers out for a drive, hikers fresh from a long day's walk and pensioners enjoying a pub lunch.

The drinking of beer in a public house is not compulsory, but as any publican will tell you, beer remains the mainstay of the trade. It is said that beer is the perfect drink for the pub - it comes in large measures (one pint glasses) so that just one drink provides plenty of conversation time!

It was hoped that the wall would help to control the fearsome Scottish tribes, but it was attacked and overrun in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and abandoned in the 4th century.

It comprises not one, but 20 towers, the oldest of which, the White Tower, dates back to the 11th century and the time of William the Conqueror. It is the Tower's evil reputation as a prison that ensures it remains a much visited tourist spot today, together with the rich and varied history that surrounds it. Many stories associated with British history come from the Tower. In 1483 King Edward IV's two sons were murdered in the so-called Bloody Tower, and over two centuries later the skeletons of two little boys were found buried beneath steps in the White Tower, assumed to be the bodies of the princes.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Traitor's Gate, set in the southern wall of the Tower, has steps leading down to the River Thames. Countless prisoners, including the future Queen Elizabeth I of England, were brought to the Tower by barge, and ascended the steps before being imprisoned - for many it was their last moment of freedom before their death. Fortunately, Elizabeth was released from the Tower and became Queen.<br/>\nElizabeth I's father, Henry VIII, made the Tower the dread destination of his enemies. Sir Thomas More was beheaded there in 1535 and the King's second wife, Anne Boleyn, was brought to trial there in 1536 and beheaded on Tower Green. Six years later her cousin, Catherine Howard, Henry VIII's fifth wife, suffered the same fate.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>The Tower is famous as home of the Crown Jewels. Today they<br/>\ncan be viewed in their new jewel house from a moving pavement, designed to cope with the huge numbers of tourists. They include the Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother which contains the celebrated Indian diamond, the Koh-i-noor (mountain of light), and St Edward's Crown which is used for the actual crowning of the Sovereign and weighs over two kilograms.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Everyone has heard of the Yeoman Warders of the Tower or 'Beefeaters', whose striking Tudor uniform has changed little since 1485. The uniform consists of a knee-length scarlet tunic, scarlet knee-breeches and stockings, and a round brimmed hat called a Tudor bonnet. Their distinctive white neck ruff was introduced by Queen Elizabeth I.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>No visit to the Tower would be complete without seeing the ravens; huge black birds who are an official part of the Tower community. Legend states that if the ravens were to leave the Tower the Crown will fall, and Britain with it. Under the special care of the Raven Master, the ravens are fed a daily diet of raw meat paid for out of a special fund set aside by Parliament. There is no danger of them flying away, as their wings are clipped!</strong></strong></p>\n"

If you visit the mountainous areas of the west and north you can expect more rainfall than in central parts of Britain. During May, June and July - the months of longest daylight - the mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight on the south coast. November, December and January have the least sunshine - only an hour a day in northern Scotland or two hours a day on the south coast of England.</strong></strong></p>\n"
