During the lesson the students will mainly work individually. They are encouraged to ask questions about things that are still unclear to them regarding the revision material, to which the teacher will provide answers and help.  \n\nAdditional information: This Wikiwijs lesson was made for 1K. 1K is a havo/vwo 'brugklas'. According to the Alfrink College, my current internship school, \u2018bruklassen\u2019 are described as the early years of high school. A time where students can decide whether they want to choose a HAVO or a VWO education. For the subject English, 1K uses Focus 1. Which is an A2/A2+ student s book.",

Because of that, it is important to revise what you learned before the break in your English classes. This way you will refresh your memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis WikiWijs lesson is made so that you revise Unit 5 and 6 on your own(individually). Don't worry. The teacher will be present in the lesson and available if you have any questions. During this lesson we will cover only the grammar and vocabulary of these two units because we only have 40 minutes( even less actually). This means that some things you have to revise on your own at home or in class during another lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease take this lesson seriously and do your best. This is your chance to find out if there are things you still don't understand. And of course, ask questions about the things you don't understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards,<br/>\nV. Galavanidou</p>\n"
