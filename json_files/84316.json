The center of this city was destroyed by bombs in the Second World War. So the city had no center anymore, the heart of the city was struck. How did the sculptor made this clear?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Pay attention to the facial expression. Does this fit to the subject (the bombing of the city)?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Let us take a further look: what kind of shapes did Zadkine use? Are they angular or round?<br/>\nDo they express softness or power? Why would Zadkine have chosen these shapes?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Think about your first ideas about this sculpture. Do you still think this way or have you changed your mind about this sculpture?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">What you just did is called <em>analysing art</em>.<br/>\nArt analysis is important to understand art, why it is made, how it is made.

You discover what is represented and how it is made by the artist. You also try to find out what purpose the work of art has.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">We look at things like: what materials are used? What colours and shapes are to be seen and what is the effect of all this?<br/>\n                    </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">The components of which a work of art is made of, are called: <strong>the elements of art</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">In the first chapter you have discovered that art is made with a purpose. And you have seen that the works of art serve different purposes. In this chapter we will have a look at the different tools which are available to the artist and how the artist can to tell us his message.<br/>\nJust like a carpenter uses his hammer, nails and wood to make a box, an artist uses visual resources to make a piece of art.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">\u25cf The <strong>visual resources</strong> are:</span><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\" style=\"color:#33cc00;\"> </span> <span class=\"font-size-18px\" style=\"color:#ff33ff;\">-materials (see Ch.2)</span><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\" style=\"color:#9900cc;\">  -tools (see Ch.2)</span><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\" style=\"color:#0066ff;\"><em>  -</em>elements of art</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">\u25cf The five most important <span style=\"color:#0066ff;\"><strong>elements of art</strong></span> are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#0066ff;\"><span class=\"font-size-18px\">  -light</span><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">  -colour</span><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">  -</span><span class=\"font-size-18px\">space</span><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">  -shape</span><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">  -composition (arrangement).</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-16px\" style=\"color:rgb(105, 105, 105);\">[In America composition is not included in the elements of art. They use another kind of schedule in formal art analysis: <strong>elements of art</strong> (line, shape/form, space, colour, light, value, texture) + <strong>principles of art</strong> (balance, emphasis, contrast, unity, movement, pattern, rythm).]</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\"><strong>Light</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">In regarding the element of light, you ask the next questions: what is the source of the light (a lamp, the sun\u2026) and what is the effect of the light?<br/>\nDoes it cast hard edged or soft edged shadows or does it cause a certain atmosphere? Is it drawing your attention to something?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/8/85c301c026e0a4f484b59d1cb18cf92840b93146.jpg\" class=\"height-491-pixels width-400-pixels\"/><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\"><em>The Elevation Of The Cross</em>, by Peter Paul Rubens in 1610</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Take a look at the painting by Rubens. What do you see? We see Christ whom is taken off the cross by several people who slowly hold him, support him and let him go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll people in the painting look at Christ. He is the center point of the representation. All attention is aimed at him. This is not only because he is at the center and because everybody is looking at him. There is another reason that causes your attention to be drawn to Christ. What is the cause?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cause is the \"spot light\" Rubens has used to shine on Christ. The background of the painting is very dark. Here and there some light shines on an arm or a shoulder, but Christ is really totally illuminated.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">The element of light has been deliberately used by Rubens.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\"><strong>Colour</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">Just like you can draw the attention to something with light, you can do this also with colour. Look at the image made by Rossetti. Because of the striking colour of the hair (amidst of all the green), our attention is drawn to it. This is intensified by the gaze of girl at us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/c/c0300cfdc0db70279179d8e4f7aa81925418e4e8.jpg\" class=\"height-446-pixels width-300-pixels\"/><br/>\n<em>La Ghirlandata</em>, by Dante Charles Gabriel Rossetti, 1873</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">You can create an ambience in a painting with colour. You can make a happy atmosphere by using different pure colours. But you will attain a total different ambience by using only dark and gloomy colours. Just compare these two paintings. [colourful - gloomy]</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">         </span></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" class=\"height-444-pixels width-699-pixels\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/4/415613a4a0c79de9328dd8088eab2786a3d4fd97.jpg\" class=\"height-298-pixels width-300-pixels\"/></p>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">     By Monet</span></td>\n<td>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/d/dc89a3a14012796ef06a405c13bab933e96cc8f7.jpg\" class=\"height-406-pixels width-300-pixels\"/></p>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">  By Picasso</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\"> </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">When colours in a painting are similar to reality, a painting will look realistic.<br/>\nYou can also choose to use different colours compared to reality, in case you want to create a whole new world.  That is one of the funny things of drawing. You are allowed to use your imagination.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\"><strong>Space  </strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/2/2e9da65474f7edf2cb21d59377f7b4b6dbc58e26.JPG\" class=\"height-266-pixels width-400-pixels\"/><br/>\n<em>Still life with an angel</em>, by Bart Schaap</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">In some paintings or drawings there is a suggestion of space. You can see what is nearby and what is further away. Or you can almost feel that a form is round and that it has got volume. You can see the plasticity. Have a look at the drawing of Bart Schaap. You can see the angel sitting in front of the round vase. It is obvious that the vase is round, that it has got volume.<br/>\nThat is because of the gradience which indicates the shadow on the vase.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/2/206a8ddaa4c82f314d093d213aafccf6ab803f68.jpg\" class=\"height-220-pixels width-300-pixels\"/>  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/c/ceeec6fe3e610e91e5600e86467bae2b3951f27e.jpeg\" class=\"height-197-pixels width-267-pixels\"/></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Elements of arts are mostly used in a combination. In the two exemples above, light and shape are combined. In this case the effect of light and shadow causes spatial effects on the surface of an object, we are talking about <strong>plasticity</strong>.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br/>\n<strong><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Shape</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Do the shapes look realistic or has the artist re-shaped them? Are they rounded or angular? What effect do they have? If the artist has used other shapes than realistic shapes, why did he do so? What is the artist aiming at? Recall the sculpture of Zadkine, The Destroyed City. Zadkine deliberately chose to use shapes that did not resemble reality.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">Lian Su, the maker of the works below, chose realistic shapes for the drawing and and for the painting she chose shapes which are not realistic. In both works perfume-bottles are represented. On the painting the forms of the bottles are not recognizable, but they seem to melt together to one new big form.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/b/b3331dd2e84ea9d0da73a994f8c243b414fefd23.JPG\" class=\"height-421-pixels width-280-pixels\"/>  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/f/feb5987c1aa20a6816d7acddb2bf243035f0bfb1.JPG\" class=\"height-421-pixels width-280-pixels\"/><br/>\n<em>Perfume bottles</em> by Liam Su                 <em>Splinters</em>, by Liam Su</span></p>\n<p><br/>\n<strong><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Composition/arrangement</span></strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">When you are making a piece of art, you always have make a choice about WHERE to put WHAT. Will you put everything in a row or do you prefer everything to be mixed up? Will you put the most important in the center. What effect will this cause? Will everything have the same height or not?<br/>\nWhen you are thinking about the position of every part of the painting, you are thinking about arrangement (or composition).</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Look at the drawing and painting of Liam (Perfume Bottles). You will see that she chose for two totally different arrangements. On the drawing the bottles are placed next to the edge of the drawing, which causes them to be partially outside the drawing. This way it looks like we are close to the bottles. It looks like we are watching a casual scene. Things that stand there by chance, and we are watching those things.<br/>\nOn the painting you can see everything is arranged around the center. The deformed bottles are on one pile in the center and the glass pieces are arranged in a circle around them. The artwork is obviously arranged around the center.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/8/8cfa641e4b68f2c45366a70bcec938a2517f65c0.jpg\" class=\"height-253-pixels width-450-pixels\"/></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">Look at the image above. What can you tell about the composition?</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n"
