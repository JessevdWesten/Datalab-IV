This is done by comparing the measured or predicted concentrations in water, soil, sediment, or air, with a reference level. Reference levels represent a dose (intake rate) or concentration in water, soil, sediment or air below which unacceptable effects are not expected. The definition of 'no unacceptable effects' may differ between regulatory frameworks, depending on the protection goal. The focus of this section is the derivation of reference levels for aquatic ecosystems as well as for predators feeding on exposed aquatic species (secondary poisoning), but the derivation of reference values for other environmental compartments follows the same principles.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Terminology and concepts</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Various technical terms are in use as reference values, e.g. the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) for ecosystems or the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for humans (Section on <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5423016\">Human toxicology</a>). The term \"reference level\" is a broad and generic term, which can be used independently of the regulatory context or protection goal. In contrast, the term \"quality standard\" is associated with some kind of legal status, e.g., inclusion in environmental legislation like the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Other terms exist, such as the terms 'guideline value' or 'screening level' which are used in different countries to indicate triggers for further action. While the scientific basis of these reference values may be similar, their implementation and the consequences of exceedance are not. It is therefore very important to clearly define the context of the derivation and the terminology used when deriving and publishing reference levels.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">PNEC</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">A frequently used reference level for ecosystem protection is the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC). The PNEC is the concentration below which adverse effects on the ecosystem are not expected to occur. PNECs are derived per compartment and apply to the organisms that are directly exposed. In addition, for chemicals that accumulate in prey, PNECs for secondary poisoning of predatory birds and mammals are derived. The PNEC for direct ecotoxicity is usually based on results from single species laboratory toxicity tests. In some case, data from field studies or mesocosms may be included.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">A basic PNEC derivation for the aquatic compartment is based on data from single species tests with algae, water fleas and fish. Effects on the level of a complex ecosystem are not fully represented by effects on isolated individuals or populations in a laboratory set-up. However, data from laboratory tests can be used to extrapolate to the ecosystem level if it is assumed that protection of ecosystem structure ensures protection of ecosystem functioning, and that effects on ecosystem structure can be predicted from species sensitivity.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Accounting for Extrapolation Uncertainty: Assessment Factor (AF) Approach</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">To account for the uncertainty in the extrapolation from single species laboratory tests to effects on real life ecosystems, the lowest available test result is divided by an assessment factor (AF). In establishing the size of the AF, a number of uncertainties must be addressed to extrapolate from single-species laboratory data to a multi-species ecosystem under field conditions. These uncertainties relate to intra- and inter-laboratory variation in toxicity data, variation within and between species (biological variance), test duration and differences between the controlled laboratory set-up and the variable field situation. The value of the AF depends on the number of studies, the diversity of species for which data are available, the type and duration of the experiments, and the purpose of the reference level. Different AFs are needed for reference levels for e.g. intermittent release, short-term concentration peaks or long-term (chronic) exposure. In particular, reference levels for intermittent release and short-term exposure may be derived on the basis of acute studies, but short-term tests are less predictive for a reference level for long-term exposure and larger AFs are needed to cover this. Table 1 shows the generic AF scheme that is used to derive PNECs for long-term exposure of freshwater organisms in the context of European regulatory framework for industrial chemicals (REACH; see Section on <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5415597\">REACH environment</a>). This scheme is also applied for the authorisation of biocidal products, pharmaceuticals and for derivation of long-term water quality standards for freshwater under the EU Water Framework Directive. Further details on the application of this scheme, e.g., how to compare acute and chronic data and how to deal with irregular datasets, are presented in guidance documents (see suggested reading: EC, 2018; ECHA, 2008). Similar schemes exist for marine waters, sediment, and soil. However, for the latter two environmental compartments often too little experimental information is available and risk limits have to be calculated by extrapolation from aquatic data using the Equilibrium Partitioning concept. The derivation of Regulatory Acceptable Concentrations (RAC) for plant protection products (PPPs) is also based on the extrapolation of laboratory data, but follows a different approach focussing on generating data for specific taxonomic groups, taking account of the mode of action of the PPP (see suggested reading: EFSA, 2013).</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-12px\" style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong>Table 1</strong>.

If enough data are available for other species than algae, daphnids and fish, statistical methods can be applied to derive a PNEC. Within the concept of species sensitivity distribution (SSD), the distribution of the sensitivity of the tested species is used to estimate the concentration at which 5% of all species in the ecosystem is affected (HC5; see section on <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5415527\">SSDs</a>). When used for regulatory purposes in European regulatory frameworks, the dataset should meet certain requirements regarding the number of data points and the representation of taxa in the dataset, and an AF is applied to the HC5 to cover the remaining uncertainty from the extrapolation from lab to field.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Where available, results from semi-field experiments (mesocosms, see section on <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5415499\">Community ecotoxicology</a>) can also be used, either on its own or to underpin the PNEC derived from the AF or SSD approach. SSDs and mesocosm-studies are also used in the context of authorisation of PPP.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Reference levels for secondary poisoning</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Substances might be toxic to wildlife because of bioaccumulation in prey or a high intrinsic toxicity to birds and mammals. If this is the case, a reference level for secondary poisoning is derived for a simple food chain: water \u00e8 fish or mussel \u00e8 predatory bird or mammal. The toxicity data from bird or mammal tests are transformed into safe concentrations in prey. This can be done by simply recalculating concentrations in laboratory feed into concentrations in fish using default conversion factors (see e.g., ECHA, 2008). For the derivation of water quality standards under the WFD, a more sophisticated method was introduced that uses knowledge on the energy demand of predators and energy content in their food to convert laboratory data to a field situation. Also, the inclusion of other, more complex and sometimes longer food chains is possible, for which field bioaccumulation factors are used rather than laboratory derived values.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px underline\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Suggested additional reading</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">EC (2018).

Instead, different regulations or directives have been developed for different categories of chemicals. These categories are typically related to the usage of the chemicals. Important categories are industrial chemicals (solvents, plasticizers, etc.), plant protection products, biocides and human and veterinary drugs. Some chemicals may belong to more than one category. Zinc, for example, is used in the building industry, but it also has biocidal applications (antifouling agent) and zinc oxide is used as a veterinary drug. In the European Union, each chemical category is subject to specific regulations or directives providing the legal conditions and requirements to guarantee a safe production and use of chemicals. A key element of all legal frameworks is the requirement that sufficient data on a chemical should be made available. Valid data on production and identity (e.g. chemical structure), use volumes, emissions, environmental fate properties and the (eco)toxicity of a chemical are the essential building blocks for a sound assessment and management of environmental risks. Rules for the minimum data set that should be provided by the actors involved (e.g. producers or importers) are laid down in various regulatory frameworks. With this data, both hazard and risk assessments can be carried out according to specified technical guidelines. The outcome of the assessment is then used for risk management, which is focused on minimizing any risk by taking measures, ranging from requests for additional data to restrictions on the particular use or a full-scale ban of a chemical.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">REACH</span></p>\n<p><span>REACH is a regulation of the European Union, adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals, while enhancing the competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry. REACH stands for Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. The REACH regulation entered into force on 1st June 2007 to streamline and improve the former legislative frameworks on new and existing chemical substances. It replaced approximately forty community regulations and directives by one single regulation.</span></p>\n<p><span>REACH establishes procedures for collecting and assessing information on the properties, hazards and risks of substances. REACH applies to a very broad spectrum of chemicals: from industrial to household applications, and very much more. It requires that EU manufacturers and importers register their chemical substances if produced or imported in annual amounts of &gt; 1 tonne, unless the substance is exempted from registration under REACH. At quantities of &gt; 10 tonnes, the manufacturers, importers, and down-stream users are responsible to show that their substances do not adversely affect human health or the environment.</span></p>\n<p><span>The amount of standard information required to show safe use depends on the quantity of the substance that is manufactured or imported. Before testing on vertebrate animals like fish and mammals, the use of alternative methods must be considered. The European Chemical Agency (<a href=\"https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach/understanding-reach\">ECHA</a>) coordinates and facilitates the REACH program. For production volumes above 10 tonnes per year, industry has to prepare a risk assessment, taking into account all risk management measures envisaged, and document this in a chemical safety assessment (CSA). A CSA should include an exposure assessment, hazard or dose-response assessment, and a risk characterization showing risks ratios below 1.0, i.e. safe use (see sections on <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5415593\">REACH Human</a> and <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5415597\">REACH Eco</a>).</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP)</span></p>\n<p><span>The <a href=\"https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/clp/understanding-clp\">EU CLP regulation</a> requires manufacturers, importers or downstream users of substances or mixtures to classify, label and package their hazardous chemicals appropriately before placing them on the market. When relevant information (e.g. ecotoxicity data) on a substance or mixture meets the classification criteria in the CLP regulation, the hazards of a substance or mixture are identified by assigning a certain hazard class and category. An important CLP hazard class is '<em>Hazardous to the aquatic environment'</em>, which is divided into categories based on the criteria, for example, <em>Category Acute 1,</em> representing the most (acute) toxic chemicals (LC50/EC50 \u2264 1 mg/L). CLP also sets detailed criteria for the labelling elements, such as the well-known pictograms (Figure 1).</span></p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/0/02559db82670fef7dbca69a653ba517f21aea406.png\" class=\"height-150-pixels width-150-pixels\"/></p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><span class=\"font-size-12px\"><span style=\"color:#7db81a;\"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> <em>Pictogram used to indicate hazardousness to the environment.

They include among others herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, plant growth regulators and repellents (see section on <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5415110\">Crop Protection Products</a>). PPPs fall under the EU Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 which determines that PPPs cannot be placed on the market or used without prior authorization. The European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) coordinates the EU regulation on PPPs.</span></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">Biocides regulation</span></p>\n<p><span>The distinction between biocides and PPP is not always straightforward, but as a general rule of thumb the PPP regulation applies to substances used by farmers for crop protection while the biocides regulation covers all other pesticide applications. Different applications of the same active ingredient, one as a PPP and the other as a biocide, may thus fall under different regulations. Biocides are used to protect humans, animals, materials or articles against harmful organisms like pests or bacteria, by the action of the active substances contained in the biocidal product. Examples of biocides are antifouling agents, preservatives and disinfectants.</span></p>\n<p><span>According to the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (<a href=\"https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/biocidal-products-regulation/understanding-bpr\">BPR</a>), all biocidal products require an authorization before they can be placed on the market, and the active substances contained in the biocidal product must be previously approved. The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) coordinates and facilitates the BPR. More or less similar to other legislations, for biocides the environmental risk assessment is mainly performed by comparing compartmental concentrations (PEC) with the concentration below which unacceptable effects on organisms will most likely not occur (PNEC).</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">Veterinary and human pharmaceuticals regulation</span></p>\n<p><span>Since 2006, EU law requires an environmental risk assessment (ERA) for all new applications for a marketing authorization of human and veterinary pharmaceuticals. For both products, guidance documents have been developed for conducting an ERA based on two phases. The first phase estimates the exposure of the environment to the drug substance. Based on an action limit the assessment may be terminated. In the second phase, information about the fate and effects in the environment is obtained and assessed. For conducting an ERA a base set, including ecotoxicity data, is required. For veterinary medicines, the ERA is part of a risk-benefit analysis, in which the positive therapeutic effects are weighed against any environment risks, whereas for human medicines the environmental concerns are excluded from the risk-benefit analysis. The <a>European Medicines Agency</a> (EMA) is responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines in the EU.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">Harmonization of testing</span></p>\n<p><span>Testing chemicals is an important aspect of risk assessment, e.g. testing for toxicity, for degradation or for a physicochemical property like the K<sub>ow</sub> (see <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/147644/Environmental_Toxicology__an_open_online_textbook#!page-5415143\">Chapter 3</a>). The outcome of a test may vary depending on the conditions, e.g. temperature, test medium or light conditions. For this reason there is an incentive to standardize the test conditions and to harmonize the testing procedures between agencies and countries. This would also avoid duplication of testing, and leading to a more efficient and effective testing system.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) assists its member governments in developing and implementing high-quality chemical management policies and instruments. One of the key activities to achieve this goal is the development of harmonized guidelines to test and assess the risks of chemicals leading to a system of mutual acceptance of chemical safety data among OECD countries. The OECD also developed Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) to ensure that studies are of sufficient quality and rigor and are verifiable. The OECD also facilitates the development of new tools to obtain more safety information and maintain quality while reducing costs, time and animal testing, such as the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/\">OECD QSAR toolbox</a>.</span></p>\n"
