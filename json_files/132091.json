On the day Alfie turns 5, the first world war starts. The next day Georgie comes home with his soldiers uniform. He starts fighting in the war. Georgie said he would be home next Christmas, but he still hasn't come home after four years. Meanwhile, Alfie is already 9 years old. When Alfie was 5 he had a friend: Jelena he often played with she comes from Prague, Czech Republic. She and her father had been living here for a while. Her father had a small shop with many things like candy and newspapers. Jelena and her father, were captured by the government of England because they come from Austria-Hungary. They are sent to a secret place where they have to stay until the war is over.</p>\n<p>Since Georgie left, Alfie and Margie have been living in poverty. Margie has many different jobs and works very hard to make enough money. Alfie wants to help too, so he steals a shoe polish box from Jelena's father. With it he goes every day except Monday and Thursday to the station to clean people's shoes for money. When he has the money he has earned, he puts it in his mother's wallet, without her knowing anything about it.</p>\n<p>Alfie wonders what happened to his father. For some time now there have been no letters coming in, which in the beginning often came. He decides to ask his mother, Margie says that his father is on a secret mission and that he can't write letters. But Alfie thinks that his mother is lying to him, and that his father has died. For a while they received very happy letters from Georgie, but after a while the letters became increasingly gloomy. That's why Margie started hiding the letters from Alfie. But Alfie knows where his mother hides everything so he finds them under her mattress. And because of what is written on the letters, Alfie begins to think that his father has died.</p>\n<p>One day, Alfie is waiting at the station for someone to have his shoes polished. Eventually someone comes along. Alfie starts talking to the gentleman. He finds out that the man is a doctor from a hospital near here. After Alfie has finished polishing the man's shoes, the man accidentally drops his papers. Alfie helps the man to pick them up again. When Alfie picks up one of the papers he sees something, he sees the name of his father who is in the hospital.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alfie decides to go to the hospital where his father is lying. He goes by train. On the train he meets a woman. They start talking to each other. The woman also goes to the same hospital. After they have arrived at the hospital, the woman wants to show him the way. Alfie thinks this is a good idea, but he can't go any further at the gate. Because no children are allowed to enter the hospital. So Alfie decides to sneak in. He sneaks very quietly into the hospital. He enters a room with wounded soldiers, Alfie sees his father lying there and talks to him, but Georgie doesn't know who he is. Georgie has forgotten everything because of the war. While Alfie is talking to Georgie he is caught by a doctor. The doctor tells Alfie to go back home. But after Alfie is home he immediately comes up with a plan to get his father out of the hospital.</p>\n<p>Alfie's going to get his father. He sneaks into the room where his father is. Alfie wakes up his father and starts talking to him. After a while, George begins to recognize Alfie again. Alfie takes his father from the hospital back to their home. They arrive at the station and Alfie and his father go home for a short time, but Alfie has to make money so he goes to the station to clean shoes. He takes his father with him. Alfie tells his father to wait at the tobacco shop. Alfie goes to clean someone's shoes. After he is finished he goes to the tobacco shop, but his father is not there. He goes back home to go find him.</p>\n<p>While Alfie is at home the bell rings. It is the doctor who caught Alfie in the hospital. He is there to say that Georgie is missing. The bell rings again, it's Joe Patience someone who lives in the street with them. And next to him is Georgie. Joe was also at the station and saw Alfie and Georgie, Georgie started running away and Joe followed him. Everyone is happy that the war is over and that Georgie is back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Own opinion:</p>\n<p>I liked the book. The book has a nice and interesting story with many nice characters. The story I found quite interesting because it covers many different things like: War, poverty, loss and other things. I liked the characters because they all had a different personality and a different view of the war. What I also liked about it was that something was always happening, so it never became really boring.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"

After it happend the guards find Bruno's clothes and they find out what really happend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Characters:</p>\n<p>Bruno:</p>\n<p>A nine year old boy who loves exploring and wants to be a explorer when he grows up. Bruno is also very smart and the son of a important general.</p>\n<p>Shmuel:</p>\n<p>A nine year old Jewish boy who becomes really good friends with Bruno</p>\n<p>Gretel:</p>\n<p>She is the sister of Bruno and  she is twelve years old. She thinks that she is alot smarter than her little brother and always reminds him of this.</p>\n<p>Ralf:</p>\n<p>The father of Bruno and Gretel. He is also a important general.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Personal opion:</p>\n<p>I thought it was a interesting book with a lot of good characters. I think that the idea behind the book is really interesting because it is really interesting to see how a nine year old sees the second world war, and how innocent he thinks. But that could sometimes  be pretty annoying because Bruno would alot of the time be annoying. It also could get pretty boring because not alot happend. But apart from that I thouht the book was pretty good</p>\n"

They come from the south of England. The story takes place in Venice, where the couple is on holiday. During their stay they hope to get clarity about their slightly cooled relationship. During an evening walk they meet Robert, a Venetian caf\u00e9 owner who also comes from England. Soon it turns out that this man is afflicted with the necessary frustrations. Robert has his very dominant and cruel father (who has passed away by now) standing incredibly high on a pedestal: the way he talks about his father is reminiscent of hero worship. Although Colin and Mary don't like him, they allow themselves to be persuaded to visit Robert's home, where they also meet his wife Caroline. Caroline has physical complaints; her back is very bad and she says she can barely walk. At first she is rather secretive about the cause of this, later it becomes clear that Robert abuses her during their sexual intimacies. However, she makes this appear to be a normal consequence of her love for him.<br/>\nRobert's behaviour towards Colin also makes one think. When Colin is unwilling to go along with Robert's extreme way of thinking about a number of things - especially about his father - he is beaten to the ground in his stomach with one fierce punch.<br/>\nThis goes unnoticed by Mary, who at that moment, to her surprise and anxiety, sees that the couple have photographs of Colin; photographs taken without their knowledge during their stay in Venice. After both have recovered from the shock, Colin and Mary trust each other about their remarkable experiences at Robert and Caroline's home; both feel confused and worried about what happened. Yet they allow themselves to be persuaded to pay another visit, this time after Caroline waved them from her porch and beckoned to her. It turns out that the couple are ready to go abroad, a definite departure; they are happy to say goodbye to Colin and Mary for a while and invite them to come in.<br/>\nThis visit is fatal to Colin. During a well-prepared scenario in which Colin has to accompany Robert to his cafe, Caroline gives Mary a narcotic drug to drink and then reveals to her all sorts of terrifying fantasies she and Robert have about Colin. It turns out they already noticed Colin when he arrived in Venice with Mary and that they are sickly attracted to him. She also shows Mary their bedroom, which is full of the pictures they secretly took of Colin. Finally, the dazed Mary has to watch her friend Colin, who has now returned with Robert and reacts with great disquiet when he finds Mary half unconscious, being sexually approached by the couple and then murdered. Mary is left alone with Colin's body while the couple get away. When the story ends, the murder and its perpetrators are known to the local police, who interrogate Mary. The officer is surprised at the careful way in which the couple prepared the murder, while at the same time they have done nothing to camouflage their planned departure to foreign countries. When it becomes clear that Mary, still in shock, is not an accomplice, she is allowed to leave. She says goodbye to the deceased Colin and packs her bags.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Personal opinion:</p>\n<p>I personally thought that the book was pretty uninteresting in the beginning. It starts of really slow and boring but it gets progressively more interesting. I also quite liked the characters, because they all had secrets. I also liked that it went to really adult themes like murder and abuse, which you don't see often.</p>\n"

Hij is een heel agressief persoon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Samenvatting:</p>\n<p>Cal Mclusckey is 19. Hij woont in een dorp bij Ulster in Noord-Ierland samen met zijn vader Shamie. Het zijn allebei katholieken. Nadat Cal van school is gegaan, krijgt hij een baan bij het slachthuis, maar Cal heeft een zwakke maag, dus hij neemt ontslag en is werkloos. Crilly neemt de baan over, hij is een oude vriend van Cal, en natuurlijk katholiek. Cal verveelt zich erg omdat hij geen baan heeft en hij is te lui om een nieuwe baan te zoeken. Crilly is lid van de IRA, hij haalt Cal over om ook lid te worden. Crilly vertelt hem dat hij een busje kan besturen dat gebruikt zal worden om protestantse winkels te overvallen. Na enkele missies moet Cal weer rijden, maar deze keer wordt er iemand vermoord, een politieman genaamd Robert Morton. Cal voelt zich er erg slecht over. Hij dacht niet of wilde niet denken dat zijn vrienden in staat waren om mensen te vermoorden. Maar Cal heeft het lef niet om nee te zeggen tegen Crilly, dus hij blijft rijden in de bus voor Crilly en Skeffington. Cal's vader ontvangt dreigementen van de protestanten, dat ze zijn huis in brand zullen steken. Cal doet alsof hij niet bang is voor de bedreigingen, maar hij weet dat het op een dag mis zal gaan. Ondertussen ontmoet Cal Marcella, ze werkt in de bibliotheek. Cal is verliefd op haar en elke keer als hij haar ziet wordt hij nog meer verliefd op haar. Als Cal boomstammen verkoopt aan mevrouw Morton bieden ze hem een baan aan op de boerderij, hij neemt de baan aan. Cal weet dat Marcella ook op die boerderij woont. De Morton's zijn Marcella's schoonfamilie. Als Cal op de terugweg naar huis gaat ziet hij een brand op de terugweg, weet hij meteen dat het zijn huis is. Ze verblijven die nacht in het huis van een vriend, zijn vader blijft daar een tijdje, maar Cal gaat naar een oud huisje in de buurt van de boerderij om uit Crilly en Skeffington te ontsnappen en dicht bij Marcella te zijn. Als de Morton's een lampje in het huisje zien, bellen ze de politie, maar als Mevr. Morton ziet dat het Cal is die ze wil dat hij blijft en het huisje inricht zodat er in het huisje kan worden gewoond. Cal en Marcella worden verliefd op elkaar. Als de Morton's naar het ziekenhuis gaan sturen Cal en Marcella veel tijd samen om de liefde te bedrijven. E\u00e9n ding steekt Cal, Marcella weet niet van Robert Morton en hem.</p>\n<p>Robert Morton was haar man en Cal was betrokken bij het incident. Shamie is in een slechte conditie, hij wordt depressief en wil niet meer werken. Hij heeft al zijn goede herinneringen verloren. Wanneer Cal in de bibliotheek is nadat hij zijn vader heeft ontmoet ziet hij Crilly een bom in een boek stoppen.</p>\n<p>Na dat incident gaan ze naar Crilly's huis. De politie komt aan bij Crilly's, hij ontsnapt het huis en gaat terug naar de boerderij waar hij voor het laatst de liefde bedrijft met Marcella. In de ochtend schrijft hij haar een brief waarin hij haar het ware gevoel voor Marcella en het waargebeurde verhaal over haar dode man in de brief beschrijft. Na een paar uur wordt Cal door de politie gearresteerd, dat herleeft Cal, want het is gerechtigheid voor wat hij verkeerd heeft gedaan. Nu kan hij een heel nieuw leven beginnen, een goed leven.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Eigen mening:</p>\n<p>Ik vond het een best interessant boek. Het boek gaat over veel interessante onderwerpen die ik leuk vind om over te lezen zoals moord. Ik vond het ook fijn dat het over een volwassen thema ging. De karakters zijn ook best goed geschreven</p>\n"

With the intention to break him out. He wants to break him out because his brother is on death row, which means that he will be executed in the next few weeks.

Because Michael is very smart it's always interesting to find out how he wants to escape the prison. Something I also like about the show is the characters because the are all really interesting and have good motivations to escape the prison. And they are also very fun to watch because they have an intersting chemistry together. Because one of the characters is black and another one hates black people. So they hate each other, but they want to get out of prison so much that they decide to trust eachother and work together to escape prison.</p>\n"

Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, Eggsy's mentor during his spy training. Harry Hart is a spy himself. Gazelle, played by Sofia Boutella is the sidekick of Richmond Valentine, played Samuel L.

They give everyone phone chips with which you can call and surf the internet for free, but which can also send out a signal that makes people extremely aggressive. They do this to combat overpopulation and climate problems</p>\n<p>Personal Opinion:</p>\n<p>I really liked the movie, because it didn't have too long talk monologues in it. The action scenes follow each other in quick succession. There's also some humour in it, like asking Eggsy (the main character in the film) to imitate a German army general, after which Eggsy does a Hitler salute. When Harry Hart clicks his heels together a knife appears, which contains poison. In the scene Eggsy meets Kingsman's technical gadgets. There are bombs that look like lighters and rings to electrocute people with. My favourite is the umbrella, which is both a shield and a weapon.</p>\n"

He believes that he is being followed by men in suits, possibly over his actions the night before. In a flashback, Elliot engineers a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography\">child pornographer</a>'s arrest by hacking the man's computer and sending its illegal content to the police. While walking home, Elliot receives a panicked phone call from Angela, his childhood best friend, begging him to come back to work. At the office, Elliot finds Lloyd (a colleague of Elliot's) and Angela attempting to stop a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack\">DDoS</a> attack on E Corp's servers. While examining the hacked server, Elliot finds a file with a message in it for him. The message simply says, \"Leave me here,\" and after a quick debate with himself, he changes the file so that only he can access it but leaves it on the server. On a train back to his home he is confronted by a man with a patch on his shirt \"mr robot\" he gets invited by this man to join a secret hacker group to take down huge company's like Evil-Corp.</p>\n<p>Personal Opinion:</p>\n<p>I thought it was a very interesting concept for a show. Elliot is very interesting because he has many mental problems which makes him very unpredicateble. It even's explains why Elliot is talking to us, we are just the voice inside his head. It can get pretty boring at times because of the lenght of the episode. The acting in this episode was really good there really wasn't any actor who did a really bad performance. I would rate this episode 8 out of 10</p>\n"

He lives a quiet and simple live after the death of his wife. But sometime after his wife and his happines dying he finds  something his wife left for him, a small dog, he shows his human and caring side. John, however, is surprised by a number of burglars who have taken it out on him. They didn't only beat John to a pulp, they also killed his dog. Only when the perpetrators have been punished can John find peace again in his life. Disaster is on its way for those responsible, and they have ties to the top of the criminal underworld. In those ranks John's name goes around with great horror. For those who are responsible for the deeds, there is nothing left but to flee for their lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Personal Opinion:</p>\n<p>It was a great movie, it was one of the best choreographed action movies I have ever seen. It used music really well, they for example used music drops and gun shots at the same time creating a really good sound. They also used color really well. The acting isn't the best in the world but it is easy to forgive with all the other things that are going for this movie. I would  give it a 8 out of 10</p>\n"

It starts with the creating of the game. They start with saying how they made it and how they got to insperation to make it in the first place. It takes a while before the game can even get launched because of many different reasons. For example: when they were trying to launch game servers in Europa, but because of the eruption of a volcano in Iceland it took alot longer than expected. After explaining how and why it was created they start going in depth about E-sports. E-sports means Electronic sports, so it's basically a virtual proffesional sport. They talk about how they got the idea for getting into E-sports and the evolution of it over the years.</p>\n<p>Personal Opinion:</p>\n<p>I personally thought it was a very interesting documentary. I already knew some of it because I am a very big fan of the game and have followed the E-sports league for a couple of years. But I think even if you haven't played or even heard about League of Legends it's still very interesting to watch. Because you learn alot about proffesional video games which are becoming very popular nowaday's so it's always good to learn more about it. Overal I think it's a pretty interesting and fun watch.</p>\n"

At this time there wasn't a single black player in the MLB. One day the owner of a MLB team get an idea, to recruit the first ever black ball player. And so he does. Robinson starts out playing in the minor leagues which are below the MLB but still, he made it to professional baseball the first black man to ever do so. But in his first couple of seasons het get alot of hate from white fans often calling him racist slurs. But Jackie ingnores them and becomes one of the best players to ever play baseball and so he proves that black people are also very capable of playing in the major leagues.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Personal opinion:</p>\n<p>I think it was a very inspiring movie, there was alot of very good messages in the movie like saying that we are all equal. Some scenes were very disturbing but very real. For example in one of the scenes a opposing team's manager start shouting the N-Word at Jackie Robinson fort about 3 minutes straight. The acting was also really great. The main actor who played Jackie Robinson play him really well. The baseball scenes were for the most part very realistic but at some points it wasn't. I would give this movie 7 out 10 stars.</p>\n"
