The story takes place in 'The replubic of America' in the year 2054.</p>\n<p>Day is looking at his old house, a plague patrol is coming by, they paint a weird x on his door, which means one or his whole family is infected with the plague. He does a raid on the hospital in which he kills the brother of June Iparis, Metias Iparis by throwing a knife at him. He gets away and the military city patrols put June on the task to trace day and bring him to justice. When she is able to trace day to his family, the military does a raid on his families home. During this raid he tries to protect his family, tho Commander Jameson, the commander of the city patrols, orders Thomas Alexander Bryant to kill Day's mother. Because of this move they are able to catch day after a fight. During the next time June starts to find out more and more about the republic as Day keeps holding on that he didn't kill Metias, he threw the knife in his shoulder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Day has light blond hair with baby blue eyes and an imperfection in one of his eyes, a limp to his left leg he is describes as extremely agile.</p>\n<p>June has long dark brown hair with brown eyes with golden flecks in them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I honestly thought the book was really good and loved it. It has an amazing plot and a lot of details in it. The English used in it is also with a lot of hard words which makes it a bit of a challenge to read. After I read this book I ordered the whole trilogy as it ends with a cliff hanger and I wanted to read further. The different views of June and Day are also really good, you get both sides and choose yours. Again, I loved it and would recommend it to everyone.</p>\n"

Katniss gets a threat from President Snow to convince the people of their love story as revolution is being rumoured in the districts. As Katniss is struggling with her feelings for Peeta she is having a hard time to actually do this. 'Convince me, for the sake of your loved ones.' - President Snow. The Capitol is starting to have trouble maintaining the order in the districts. In a response, President Snow decides that for the Quarter-Quelle, every district must reap 2 victors out of the existing victors, no matter of their health, state of mind or state of body. Katniss is the only victor of 12 and has to go back in the arena.</p>\n<p>Katniss: A young, strong woman, who would do anything to protect her loved ones, but due to the first Hunger games, mentally not stable.</p>\n<p>Peeta: Katniss' half fake/real love, it is quite clear what Peeta's feelings are towards Katniss. He is the same age and physically strong.</p>\n<p>Prim: Katniss' sister for whom she volunteered in the first book, she seems grown up since the first book and determined to support Katniss on whatever she can.</p>\n<p>Gale: Katniss' best friend, and it's quite clear he is jalous of the relation between Katniss and Peeta.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In my opinion it is a great book, I would read it again and again. The story just takes a hold of you and doesn't want to let you go until you've read the whole book, and as it is the Hungergames, it ends with a dirty cliffhanger that makes you want to read the next book. The first book is perfectly continued in the second book  and in my opinion a great transition to a couple of months later. As you read you get more and more the impression as if Katniss isn't mentally stable and might have a from of PTSD, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, due to the first Hungergames in which she saw many die. In my opinion Gale develops to be an A**hole in the second book, he continues to let his Jalous feelings towards the relation of Katniss and Peeta get in the way of rational thinking. Again, in my opinion a great book and I would give it an 8.5/10.</p>\n"

Captain John Miller has to fight against the German defences on Omaha beach, Normandy, France. After a hard battle one of the soldiers who was killed, a certain Ryan, is found. As soon as this comes through in the offices they uncover that not only this Ryan, but also 2 of his brothers were killed in action. The last brother, James Ryan, may go home because of a special policy in the American army. Captain Miller and a crew of 8 men have to find him deep in to German lines, were they experience more of the war.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I honestly think the movie was amazing, I loved it. It has a great storyline and there is some kind of truth in it for what I read. The strong point of this movie is that you can place yourself into the men, you can feel what they are feeling, and they did this very well. From me, this movie gets a 9.5 out of 10.</p>\n"

The defenses that spread from all the way up to Norway, down to France that were supposed to hold back an Allied invasion whenever they'd come. A long the whole coast of Western Europe there are still ruins of the bunkers that were once manned by the Nazi's, who were prepared to give their life for their country and slaughter all invaders with the high caliber MG34 and lots of artillery. Hitler expected the Allies to invade a port, because it would be easy to ship in supplies from Brittain, but when Goebbels visited Omaha beach, he thought the Allies would pick that spot. He thought that because of the form of the beach, it had the exact same form as the beach the Allies invaded in Italy. Goebbels was shocked, there were no bunkers, only small trenches and machine gun nests, he immidiately commanded that the beach would get bunkers. The researchers conclude in the episode that the mistake in this project was that the supplies were spread to thin and the heaviest bunkers focused to much in a few places.</p>\n"
