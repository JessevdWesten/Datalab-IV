Over the course of this school year, you are going to read lyrics, newspaper and magazine articles, short stories, poems and books of your own selection. You may select any kind of reading and will be expected to read consistently over the course of the year. If you finish one article or book, you are responsible for selecting another one. So keep on reading and remember to impress yourself. I hope you will have pleasure in reading !</p>\n<p><strong>Personal details &amp; Reading Motivation Survey</strong></p>\n<p><strong>F</strong>irst I would like to get to know you better. So fill out the personal details and the reading motivation survey <strong><em>(Personal Details - Appendix I and Reading Motivation Survey Appendix II)</em></strong> ; tell me about your reading habits, please.</p>\n<p><strong>Importance of Reading</strong></p>\n<p><strong>T</strong>here are loads of people that love reading; its invitation to escape into a different world and to forget the stress in everyday life. Many believe reading to be an essential tool in order to learn what you need to learn; it opens new opportunities and ideas and improves your concentration. Reading is the best way to become educated; it enhances your breadth of knowledge, builds your self-esteem and improves creativity. But if you are the kind of person who does not like reading, you might be missing out on discovering why reading actually matters. And it does really matter. It fills our mind with all kinds\u2028of information and it expands your\u2028view on the world; It gives you a\u2028glimpse into other cultures and\u2028places. Reading every day lets your\u2028brain digest the information that it has\u2028been fed. So the more you read the\u2028more you broaden your horizon. In\u2028fact, it can be life changing in so many\u2028ways. So think about some of the\u2028most important books that you have\u2028read so far. Reading is not a contest.\u2028So what if you read slowly or sometimes skip words here and there? If you are interested in your reading material, you will read to the end, and that is what counts. And remember what they say is true: the more you read, the better you read. If you make an effort to read every day, for example two chapters a day, you will not only improve your reading skills, but you will also learn a lot of new vocabulary. Try it; good reading skills are essential to future success in your career !</p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/7/7596c68d25fd88c46586c91ed2fd6c987c9aad5d.jpeg\" class=\"height-197-pixels width-293-pixels\"/></p>\n<p> </p>\n"

At the end of this trimester you will have to hand in your reading materials and the appropriate reading challenges.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Trimester 2</em></strong></p>\n<p>During trimester two, you should choose one the following reading materials: a newspaper article, magazine article, blog, review or a short story plus the appropriate reading challenge. When you have finished these, find a book you are going to read. You can choose any type of book that you enjoy reading, though you will be advised to choose books that will improve your reading ability. It is important that you check your book with your teacher before you actually start reading your book to be absolutely certain that the book is suitable for the ReadBox Project. For, example if your book has large font or a small number of words per page, you need contact your teacher. At the end of this trimester you will have to hand in your reading materials and the appropriate reading challenges.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Trimester 3</em></strong></p>\n<p>At the beginning of this trimester you will have finished reading your book. Now it is time to start working on your final reading challenge. Please be prepared that you will have to present this last reading challenge.</p>\n<p>Every time you select a new reading material, you must go through the following steps:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1  Select your reading material from the Reading Challenge for the trimester. \u2028</p>\n<p>2  Enter your reading material in your Reading Log. Once you are done, upload the \u2028form to your ReadBox folder in Edmodo. \u2028</p>\n<p>3  Select the appropriate assignment for your reading material. \u2028</p>\n<p>4  After you have finished reading the lyrics, newspaper/ magazine article, short \u2028story or book, do the appropriate assignment of your choice (see ReadBox folder \u2028on Edmodo). Don't forget to use the Vocabulary Notebook (see next page) \u2028</p>\n<p>5  Discuss your reading process with your teacher so that (s)he can check off your \u2028assignment. \u2028</p>\n<p>6. Select your new reading material and repeat the above steps. </p>\n<p><strong>Vocabulary Notebook</strong></p>\n<p>As you read, identify unknown words. For each chapter (or lyrics/ poem/ newspaper or magazine article/ short story etc.), you should come up with at least four words. If you cannot find four unknown words, try to find higher level words in the text. Copy each word, write down the page number, part of speech, the Dutch translation, and the dictionary definition and an example sentence in your personal vocabulary notebook and learn them by heart. Don't forget: Learning new vocabulary helps to improve the word choice in your writing ! So build your vocabulary ! <strong><em>(Vocabulary Notebook - Appendix V)</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Use this form to keep track of important ideas, thoughts, questions, and vocabulary while you read your magazine articles/books etc. It helps you to maximise your learning. <strong><em>(Notes - Appendix VI)</em></strong></p>\n<p>Keep all of these items mentioned above both in your ReadBox folder on Edmodo and on your computer at home. You will need to hand them in at the end of each trimester as part of your test grades.</p>\n<p><strong>Conferencing</strong></p>\n<p>I will be discussing your selection of articles and books and your ReadBox\u2028process at various times throughout the trimester. Please be prepared to\u2028discuss your reading materials and assignments and to answer questions. Remember that all ReadBox challenges should demonstrate that you put a lot of time and effort into this project. All details should be refined and show careful planning and contemplation. This should look like it took not hours but days to complete your project. The ReadBox challenges should demonstrate understanding of the reading material from beginning to end.</p>\n<p>So start your reading engines and get started on your ultimate ReadBox challenge !</p>\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/1280/poster/2014/02/3026923-poster-p-1-how-busy-people-make-time-to-read-and-you-can-too.jpg\" class=\"height-450-pixels width-800-pixels\"/></p>\n<p><strong>How to find your reading material</strong></p>\n<p><strong>D</strong>uring this ReadBox Project you are going to read various authentic texts such as lyrics, newspaper/ magazine articles and books etc. In order to read for pleasure you should look for articles and books that match your interests and sparkle your enthusiasm for reading. How are you going to find the reading material you are looking for ?</p>\n<p>Here are some tips:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Decide what you're in the mood for</em></strong></p>\n<p>First of all you have to decide what mood your in for. What book genre suits you best? Are you into action and adventure, science fiction, romance, drama, satire, mystery, history, poetry, comics/ graphic novels, autobiographies, journals etc ? Perhaps you enjoyed a recent film or TV miniseries; chances are it was based on a book you would enjoy also.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ask around or get recommendations from social media</em></strong></p>\n<p>Ask someone in your circle of friends or in your family, or a teacher for any book which are must-reads. They will probably even lend you a book.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Check out the (school) library</em></strong></p>\n<p>Make time to visit the (school) library and check out the English section. Are there any books of your interest? Spend some time looking at the cover, and reading a chapter of two, before checking it out to ensure it fits your interests. It won't cost you anything. Librarians do tend to be literature fans, so talk to them for their recommendation.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Browse in a bookshop</em></strong></p>\n<p>Just look around and find the English section and see if there are any books that interest you. Don't judge a book only by looking at its cover; what you see on the cover is not necessarily what you get. Read the short reviews printed inside a dust jacket, or skim the first few chapter to find out what a book is really about. If the book is not for you, put it aside and try another, until you find your book.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Browse the net</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you are looking for a particular kind of book, you can do google searches to find appropriate titles. You can consult book and author-related blogs where teenagers\u2028get together to discuss books and have a list of books other people have enjoyed on\u2028the net. You could have a look at Library websites; they also provide suggested reading lists. Or search for community websites, such as <strong>Goodreads</strong> or <strong>Shelfari</strong>, which allow you to connect with literature fans around the world. You can find good books within minutes. You can also consult the next pages. </p>\n"

Pop song lyrics are both meaningful and motivating authentic material, so why not use them for our ReadBox project ?! By listening to music and reading the lyrics, you will be getting used to the English language's flow, intonation and rhythm <em>and</em> you will be learning and practicing your thinking skills all the same time.</p>\n<p>It turns out that a lot of these songs actually have stories behind them. A lot of these great songs come from interesting personal experiences and are stories from the artists who write them. So the songs you listen to are really just stories or poems and you could say that songwriters are authors. We would like you to dig up those lyrics that you can identify with; do they relate to your own experiences and values ?! Songs that work best are almost normally those that produce some sort of response to the music. So choose a song with a good story line or a song which requires you to actually work out what it is about.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"

Perhaps you even had to memorise a poem at some point or even had to write a poem yourself.</p>\n<p>But what exactly is poetry ? Poetry refers to literary works written in verse. A poet pays attention to structure, tone, form and choice of words. All of these things together create the effect the poet is trying to achieve.</p>\n<p>Poetry serves many purposes. It can be entertaining and moving; it can communicate; it can produce an emotional response in the reader and create an experience. If a poet follows a specific structure of writing a poem - with rhymes and meters (the poem's rhythm structure), it is considered to be a great poem. The beauty of these literary works is that they may have different meanings, depending on the readers' understanding. Poetry should make contact with every part of you. You should think of poetry as a creative form of expression. A poet, like an artist, has many tools for crafting a poem - each having a different effect on how the poem sounds, feels, looks and is read.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"

In doing so, you will explore the power of images and how they can enhance a story. You will also be challenged to break down the original story (your book) into its most important events and focus on details and mood, strengthening your storytelling skills. This project will show you that stories are not only told with words - images can also be used to relate serious stories as well as funny ones. An art form like the comic, which we know best for humour and superheroes, is an effective method for all types of stories. During this project you will learn how to work with a storyboard in order to create a digital story with pictures that flow together smoothly. You will also learn how to include details that explain the action - all vital skills for written storytelling, as well. Students who know how to tell stories know how to organise and communicate their ideas in any medium. Apps like <a href=\"http://plasq.com/education/\"><strong>Comic Life</strong></a> are great for adding speech bubbles and dialogue to photos or art work. The online comic editors like <strong>ToonDoo</strong> offer a range of backgrounds, characters and props to help you tell your story.</p>\n"

There are other effective ways for a student to demonstrate understanding of a book they have just read. My main goal is that students enjoy and appreciate reading. I think there are alternative assignments that allow you to show understanding of a book and that might be a lot more enjoyable than writing a book report: Let's start using technology !</p>\n<p> </p>\n"

Now you have reached the end of this project and I would like you to reflect on your own learning process. Having finished the last processing task in the project, please fill out this self-reflection form in English (or in Dutch if you do not know how to express yourself in English).
