You'll probably want to do this with your non-dominant hand.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"font-size-12px\">Using your free hand, grasp the balloon with your other hand and twist the balloon until you're left with a segment in your hand (think of turning a lid on a peanut butter jar)</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"font-size-12px\">Now you will have the basic building block of balloon sculpting.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-12px\">Important! Try to hold both newly-formed sections of the balloon in your hand. If you let go of the second segment, the balloon will untwist. To keep the balloon twisted, you'll need to learn the lock twist.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-12px\">After the basic twist, the second fundamental skill in balloon twisting is the lock twist, which you'll learn here.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-12px\">After creating a basic twist, you'll notice that unless you hold the two sections of the balloon, it will tend to untwist itself, which is why you need to learn the lock twist.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-12px\">The lock twist effectively holds the balloon's segments in place so you can continue to twist and form a sculpture. You'll also find that the lock twist forms the basic for such things as the head and ears of dog sculpture, as well as the legs and body and more.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"font-size-12px\">To start, apply two consecutive basic twists to create two balloon segments. You'll now have four balloon segments. To make this easier, try and create two small segments, as shown in the picture. When starting out, it's important that you try to get the two sections as close to each other in size as you can.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"font-size-12px\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Take the end of the balloon and bend or curl it against the first part of the balloon. You'll want the bend to occur between your two balloon segments (the second and third) that you created with the basic twists.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"font-size-12px\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Grab the two segments and twist them as shown by the arrow. As with the basic twist, think of twisting off the lid of a peanut butter jar. You're effectively twisting the two balloon segments together and isolating them from the rest of the balloon. You'll need to make at least three twists.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"font-size-12px\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">You'll find that the twists now stay in place. This is the foundational twist that forms a dog's head in a</span> dog balloon figure <span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">and more.</span></span>\n<div class=\"text-align-center\">\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/2/220abd454338432b32923afebf683acc66f751ea.PNG\" class=\"height-315-pixels width-319-pixels\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"

Make sure you hang on to both ends of balloon, otherwise it will untwist. Twist it around 2 or 3 times. Do not worry; it will not break. Why didn't it break? There is space at the end of the balloon for the extra air. That is why we only blow the balloon up half way.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>--While holding on to the twisted balloon, make another bubble the same size. This will be the one ear. Do not let go.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>--Make another balloon bubble the same size. This is the other ear.  </p>\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>--Twist balloon joints A (between bubble 1 and 2) &amp; B (between bubble 3 &amp; rest of balloon) together. Twist 2 or 4 times all the way around. The balloon will not break, and they will stay together.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong>--Now for the neck. Twist a 2 to 3-inch bubble (3 or 4 fingers wide). This is the neck. Make sure you hang on to the balloon, both parts.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 7</strong>--Let's make the legs, after all--we want your dog to stand. Start by twisting a 2 to 3-inch bubble. Hang on to the neck as you twist the balloon, and do not let go of the leg.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 8</strong>--Second leg, same as the first. Twist a 2 to 3-inch bubble. Twist those two parts together just like you did with the ears. Remember twist around each other 4 or 5 times. Twist the parts together to look like the drawing.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 9</strong>--Have a lot of balloon left over? Hotdog! Make your dog's body longer.</p>\n<p>Congratulations, you have just made your first balloon dog.</p>\n"
