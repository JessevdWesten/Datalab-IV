The egg can be fertilized for 12 to 24 hours after it's released as it travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus. If an egg meets up with a sperm cell that has made its way into the fallopian tube, it combines into one cell, a process that's known as fertilization or conception. At fertilization, the <strong>sex</strong> of the fetus is already determined, depending on whether the egg receives an X or Y chromosome from a sperm cell. If the egg receives an X chromosome, the baby will be a girl; a Y chromosome means the baby will be a boy. </p>\n<p>It takes about three to four days for the fertilized egg (or embryo) to move to the lining of the uterus, where it attaches or <a href=\"http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases_conditions/hic_am_i_pregnant/hic-fetal-development-stages-of-growth\">implants to the uterine wall</a>. Once the <strong>embryo</strong> is implanted, the cells start to grow eventually becoming the <strong>fetus</strong> and the placenta, which is tissue that can transport oxygen, nutrients and hormones from the mother's blood to the developing fetus throughout pregnancy.</p>\n<h2><strong>First trimester development of embryo/fetus  </strong></h2>\n<p>A developing baby is called an embryo from the moment conception takes place until the eighth week of pregnancy. </p>\n<p>During the <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/patients/faqs/prenatal-development-how-your-baby-grows-during-pregnancy\">first month of pregnancy</a> the heart and lungs begin to develop, and the arms, legs, brain, spinal cord and nerves begin to form. The embryo will be about the size of a pea around one month into a pregnancy. Around the second month of pregnancy, the embryo has grown to the size of a kidney bean. In addition, the ankles, wrists, fingers and eyelids form, bones appear, and the genitals and inner ear begin to develop. </p>\n<p>After the eighth week of pregnancy and until birth occurs, a developing baby is called a fetus.</p>\n<p>By the end of the second month, eight to 10 of the fetus' main organs will have formed, which is why to pregnant women it's extremely important to not take harmful medications, such as illegal drugs during that time. The first trimester is also the period when most <strong><a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/44663-miscarriage.html\">miscarriages</a></strong> and birth defects occur. </p>\n<p>During the third month of pregnancy, bones and muscles begin to grow, buds for future teeth appear, and fingers and toes grow. The intestines begin to form and the skin is almost transparent. </p>\n<div class=\"text-align-center\">\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/7/768c5fa9879a0edc72a6b44ca9092863531f5efe.jpg\" class=\"height-467-pixels width-700-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>Figure 1, Stages of fetal development over 38 weeks, from embryo to full-term.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Second trimester development of the fetus </strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20046151\">In the second trimester</a>, the fetus is growing a lot and will be between 3 and 5 inches long. Somewhere between 18 and 22 weeks an <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/45582-boy-or-girl.html\">ultrasound may reveal the sex of the baby</a>, if parents want to know it in advance. </p>\n<p>By the fourth month of pregnancy, eyebrows, eyelashes, fingernails and the neck all form, and the skin has a wrinkled appearance. Some other highlights this month include that the arms and legs can bend, the kidneys start working and can produce urine, and the fetus can swallow and hear. </p>\n<p>In the fifth month of pregnancy, the fetus is more active and a woman may be able to feel its movements. The fetus also sleeps and wakes on regular cycles.</p>\n<p>By the sixth month of pregnancy, hair begins to grow, the eyes begin to open and the brain is rapidly developing. Although the lungs are completely formed, they don't yet function. </p>\n<h2><strong>Third trimester development of the fetus </strong></h2>\n<p>By the <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/fetal-development/art-20045997\">seventh month of pregnancy</a>, the fetus kicks and stretches, and can even respond to light and sound. The eyes can open and close. </p>\n<p>During the eighth month of pregnancy, the fetus gains weight very quickly. Bones harden, but the skull remains soft and flexible to make delivery easier. Different regions of the brain are forming, and the fetus is able to hiccup.</p>\n<p>The ninth month is the home stretch of pregnancy and the fetus is getting ready for birth by turning into a head-down position in a woman's pelvis. The lungs are now fully mature to prepare for functioning on their own. The fetus continues to gain weight rapidly. </p>\n<p>The new definition of a full-term pregnancy is when a baby is born after 39 to 40 weeks (it used to be 37 weeks). </p>\n"
