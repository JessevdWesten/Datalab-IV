He said: 'I was inspired by a similar machine built on a television show called <em>Bang Goes The Theory</em>. I used to dress up as Spider-Man when I was younger and I still love all Spider-Man films, so it's great to be able to climb walls like him.'</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At first the teachers didn't think he'd be able to scale walls with his invention, and they were amazed! It took Hibiki five months to make the gadget in a technology design class. He also took his invention home every day to work on it during the evenings together with his dad.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When Hibiki was asked the following question: 'Could you tell me how this machine works?' he answered: 'You need two vacuum cleaners. First you install square wooden pads to the <span class=\"underline\">nozzles</span>. The machine needs electricity so you need to plug it into the wall socket. Then you have to press the suction pads on the wall, they carry your weight and let you climb. To climb, push the red button. Remember that you cannot climb too high or else the plug will pull out and you'll fall.'</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>'My mum thinks it's brilliant but she won't let me use it in my bedroom as she is worried I may pull down the ceiling. I've climbed up the school wall. It's not scary and I completely trust the machine.'</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hibiki goes to King's College School in Cambridge. This school is famous because it trains the <span class=\"underline\">choristers</span> of King's College. The choristers are selected at an annual audition.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n<p>Interesting facts:</p>\n<p>- King's college prep school is a school with more than 400 boys and girls.</p>\n<p>- All choristers are full boarders, which means they live at the school.</p>\n<p>- Girls were allowed at the school in 1976.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Adapted from: www.news.bbc.co.uk</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Words to help</strong></p>\n<p>suction device     <em>zuigapparaat</em></p>\n<p>nozzles                 <em>zuigmonden</em></p>\n<p>choristers             <em>leden van het koor</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"height-22-pixels width-555-pixels\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"height-22-pixels width-555-pixels\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n"

Ludo started as <em>Pachisi</em>, a game played in India in the 6th century. Variations of the game came to England during the late 19th century. In 1896 the game became a huge success: Ludo was born.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Many people in many different countries play the game. It has many different names all over the world. For example: the Americans call it <em>Parcheesi</em> or <em>Sorry!</em> In the Czech Republic, it is called <em>\u010clov\u011b\u010de, nezlob se</em>, which means 'Don't be angry, man'. In Sweden it is known as <em>Fia!</em> or 'So be it!'</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The game board and tokens</strong></p>\n<p>The board has a <span class=\"underline\">game track</span> of many white <span class=\"underline\">squares</span> and looks like an X. There are four coloured home bases (yellow, green, red, and blue). These home bases are four squares. A fifth coloured square is the player's starting square. Each player has four tokens of a matching colour. These tokens were originally made of bone but nowadays they are made of wood or plastic. <span class=\"underline\">Besides</span> the tokens you need a dice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The basic rules</strong></p>\n<p>Two, three, or four people may play. At the beginning of the game all tokens are out of play. Each player rolls the dice, the highest roller begins the game. To put a token on its starting square a player must roll a 6. He then starts racing it clockwise around the board along the game track. When reaching his home base, the player brings his token home. The first player who brings all four tokens home wins the game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The extra rules; the annoying ones</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rolling of a 6 gives the player a bonus roll in that turn. If he rolls another 6, the player may roll the dice again, and again, and again \u2026</li>\n<li>If someone's token lands on the same square as your token \u2026 you have to take yours from the board and start all over again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_(board_game)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Words to help</strong></p>\n<p>token                     <em>pion, poppetje</em></p>\n<p>game track           <em>speelveld</em></p>\n<p>square                  <em>vakje</em></p>\n<p>besides <em>                behalve</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n"
