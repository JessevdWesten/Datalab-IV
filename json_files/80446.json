The enclosure would be irregular or curvilinear. A castle built in or after 1200 would have arrow slits. In fact, all levels of the castle could be used for archery whether it would concern habitable floors or rooms or not. Another thing that castles from 1200 onwards did have and earlier castles didn't is the portcullis or strong iron gate. This type of castle would have been designed into a polygon or a square and its keep would have been polygonal or cylindrical (not square). In some cases the castle would not have a keep, for the costs of the new type of defence would be too high. (King, 1988)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\">The thirteenth century, especially the period of the great building campaigns of Edward I, is regarded as the most successful period of English castle-building. It is the time of a growing desire for symmetrical castles. They could still have a motte with a tower in this era, with the tower functioning as its keep, according to King (1988). Although not provable, according to Thompson (1987) it is reasonable to assume the building of mottes was discontinued around 1200 unless they were fortified with stone and had become useless by the end of the fourteenth century. (Thompson, 1987)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\">At the end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth more complex towers were on the rise. Round towers on top of a square, rectangular or polygonal base stem from this period. Most towers would be large enough to provide comfortable chambers which could be equipped with a fireplace and a kind of toilet (latrine). Towers were essential to the defence of the castle. (King, 1988) People began adapting castles for the use of gunpowder and a sort of gun from about 1370.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\">Thirteenth-century castles look like they were primarily built as defences with houses as some sort of afterthought, according to King (1988). Fourteenth-century castles with their defences and internal buildings, on the other hand, seem to be a planned whole. They were usually built on low and level ground. In the south of England castles were typically built by the head of an emerging family and in the north castles were usually built by established nobles. Moats became an important part of castle's defences in this century and continued to be used in the fifteenth century.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\">In the fifteenth century castles in England were on the decline. The scale at which new castles were built was much smaller and their quality was less. Fifteenth-century castles looked a lot like castles from the previous century; architects didn't experiment as much and the castle did not really evolve, except for the greater use of machicolations. (King, 1988) According to the page on castle architecture in the online version of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Britannica, Castle Architecture, n.d.) machicolations were openings in roofs of passages, walls or gates through which missiles could be dropped, thrown or shot.</span></p>\n"
