If you know these word combinations it will help you improve your <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>fluency</strong> as you will not need to stop to choose every single word you use. Therefore, <strong>it is of paramount importance for you to be aware of the existence of collocations and to learn to identify them in the input you receive.</strong> <strong>Also,</strong> you'll find it much easier to understand native speakers if you recognize collocations when used without emoji's ;)</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"font-size-14px\"><strong>Use at least 10 collocations</strong> from the lists to <strong>write a short summary</strong> of a book or film/series that you have recently read or seen (250-300 words approx).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\">4) Opinion piece\u2026recent news events..</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-14px\">Write your opinion piece.
