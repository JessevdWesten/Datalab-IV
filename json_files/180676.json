His first voyage sees him washed ashore in Lilliput, whose inhabitants are less than six inches tall. They manage to take him prisoner, but he is soon released and becomes an honoured guest. Although he helps the Lilliputians in a war with their neighbours, their gratitude soon fades and he is charged with treason. He manages to put out to sea where he is rescued and returned home.

Of course, there is so much more to the simplified story that many people know.</p>\n<p>This work of fiction, published by Daniel Defoe in 1719, was written like an autobiography. Defoe was, amongst others, a journalist, businessman, manufacturer and government spy. He wrote the novel in journalistic fashion: he gives the facts as fully and accurately as possible.</p>\n<p>Although the story is fictional, <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> is based on the account of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotsman, who was left behind on the isle of Juan Fernandez, off the coast of Chile, and stayed there from 1704 till 1709.</p>\n<p>In this task you are going to find out who this real Robinson Crusoe was by watching a History Channel documentary.</p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">Write the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>After having watched the documentary, write a brief summary of the contents in which you include <strong>Selkirk's childhood</strong>, <strong>life at sea</strong>, <strong>his rescue</strong> and <strong>his life in London afterwards (approximately 50-70 words)</strong></li>\n<li>What if you were on this uninhabited island? What would you do to survive? Mention two things that you would have done the same as Selkirk and two things you would have done differently. Motviate your answer. <strong>(30-50 words)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/c/c2ad966d5a637efa22984bac931f6f38d5da6c33.png\" class=\"height-126-pixels width-226-pixels\"/>      <a class=\"content-link-button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3IpqopuVZw\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\">The real Robinson Crusoe</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n"

Initially honoured to go off to Belgium or France to fight for your country, but then faced by the horrors of war: life in the trenches, gas attacks and the unrelenting sound of canons. The First World War (28 July 1914- 11 November 1918) was a war in which over nine million soldiers died. It was supposed to be a war to end all wars. Unfortunately, we know this to be untrue.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"underline\">Assignment 1: WWI</span></strong></p>\n<p>Watch the first four minutes of this video to understand               Watch the next video (3 minutes) about life in the trenches:</p>\n<p>how the war started:</p>\n<p>:<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PbwH1ZBnYds\" width=\"300\" class=\"video-item\"/>           <iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_G4ZY66BG38\" width=\"300\" class=\"video-item\"/></p>\n<p>Describe in your own words what life in the trenches really meant.</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"underline\">Assignment 2: war poets</span></strong></p>\n<p>Some of these soldiers fighting at the front shared their experiences by writing poetry. At first these poems tended to be optimistic and patriotic, but as the war continued an angrier mood started to appear.</p>\n<p>Read the poems <strong><em>In Flanders Fields</em></strong> by John McCrae and <strong><em>The Soldier</em></strong> by Rupert Brooke in your Poems and Extracts reader. You can use the following links to hear these poems read out loud:</p>\n<p><a class=\"content-link-button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljJy_nAtO8Q\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\">In Flanders Fields</a>   <a class=\"content-link-button\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcDQZTJU_aA\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\">The Soldier</a></p>\n<p>Although you might not understand every detail of these two poems, try to understand the main idea.</p>\n<p>Answer the following questions:</p>\n<p>1. Describe what happens in both poems.</p>\n<p>2. Explain for both poems whether they are patriotic or not. Explain your answer by giving examples from the poems.</p>\n<p>Now read a third poem in your Poems and Extracts reader: <strong><em>To the Warmongers</em></strong> by Siegfried Sassoon. Answer the following questions:</p>\n<p>3. What is described in the first part of the poem (\"I'm back again .... pass them by.\")?</p>\n<p>4. \"For you our battles shine\". Who is or are meant with 'you'?</p>\n<p>5. How does this poem compare to the two previous poems?                                      </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"underline\">Assignment 3: Siegfried Sassoon</span></strong></p>\n<p>Sassoon is famous for his angry poems about the war. He even took one step further. He did not only protest by means of his poems, but also in another way. Find out on the internet what he did and what the consequences were. Write down briefly in your own words.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"
