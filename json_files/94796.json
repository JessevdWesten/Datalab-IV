Think of assignments related to news, books, tv and the internet.</p>\n<p>During school year 2016-2017, the Media File includes doing three book-related <em><strong>Assignments</strong></em> and three <strong><em>Book</em></strong> <em><strong>Analyses</strong></em> (so, one Assignment and one Book Analysis per book). It's a portfolio that showcases which books you've read and your understanding of said books. We have made some changes after the first deadline (e.g. no video diary anymore). That's why it's important to read this page thoroughly.</p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">Handing in:</span> You hand in the Media File as a <strong>word file</strong> in 'Magister opdrachten'. Some media file assignments require you to post something online. This can be a private video on YouTube / Vimeo / Onedrive / GoogleDrive, a blog on Blogger or actually sending an e-mail to an author. This means you will have to post separate assignments elsewhere as well.</p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">New</span> The Video Diary part of the Media File is no longer part of the Media File this year. Instead, you'll write a Book Analysis which includes: a brief summary about your book, the answers to three thought and analysis provoking questions (that you choose).</p>\n<p><span class=\"underline\">Grades:</span> For each Media File you will receive separate grades for the Assignment and for the Book Analysis. The average grade of these two will be the grade for your Media File and it will count <strong>2x</strong>,</p>\n<p>The image below should make things clear.</p>\n<h2>Glossary:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>diary = dagboek</li>\n<li>assignment = opdracht</li>\n<li>collection = verzameling</li>\n<li>showcases = laten zien</li>\n<li>understanding = begrip</li>\n<li>said = eerder genoemde</li>\n<li>hand in = inleveren</li>\n<li>in addition = bovendien, daarnaast</li>\n<li>require = vereisen</li>\n<li>actually = eigenlijk, echt</li>\n<li>separate = losse</li>\n<li>elsewhere = andere plekken</li>\n<li>meaning = wat betekent</li>\n<li>grade = cijfer</li>\n<li>weight = gewicht</li>\n<li>brief = korte</li>\n<li>average = gemiddeld</li>\n</ul>\n"

Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based. (source: wikipedia)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What is Canon?!</h2>\n<p>It's important to respect canon. This might be a weird word, but let us explain. Example: People in Harry Potter books fly brooms. Giving Hermoine the ability to fly without a broom (or dark magic) would be disrespectful to canon. Changing Hermoine's life however is acceptable. You could, for example, write about Hermoine's parents. They are Muggle and that greatly affects her life (she chose to erase herself from their memory and that hurts her.) You could write a story in which Hermoine is not born from Muggle parents but from wizard parents. Describe how that could affect her personality. Maybe Hermoine is such a great student because she continuously had to prove she herself is a good wizard even though she is Muggle born. If her parents hadn't been muggles she might have worked less hard which could've affected Harry in many ways as well. Hermoine helped Harry in with her knowledge she had acquired by hard work. Had she been less motivated to learn Harry would've faced more challenges alone.</p>\n<h2>Here are the step-by-step instructions (follow them carefully):</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have an account on FanFiction.net. It may take up to 1 day or even 1 week until you can post something there. This is their way of preventing spam.</li>\n<li>Make sure you start on time. Check out the deadline date and put it one week earlier, so that you still have time to get ill or have technical problems without being too late.</li>\n<li>Choose a book of the right level. You can choose it from the \"Book Suggestions\" chapter on the previous page on this site</li>\n<li>You can write Fan Fiction individually, or with two people who <strong>all have the same teacher of English</strong></li>\n<li>Write Fan Fiction, meeting the following requirements:\n<ul>\n<li>It has to be 750-1500 words long (if you work individually) or 2000-3000 words long (if you work with two people)</li>\n<li>You have total creative freedom, as long as you respect 'canon' (remember, the thing we wrote about above, ask your teacher if you're not sure)</li>\n<li>Be creative</li>\n<li>Pay attention to good English grammar and spelling</li>\n<li>Write as well as you can</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Post it on FanFiction.net</li>\n<li>Download the \"Hand in Media File and Feedback.docx\" document from the \"Hand in Media File\" chapter on the previous page</li>\n<li>Cut and paste all the right texts in the right spaces in that document. For the Fan Fiction assignment, this is the URL of the trailer <strong>plus the full text of your Fan Fiction</strong></li>\n<li>Save the file with the file name \"class - surname - first name.docx\" (for example \"3Ab - Janssen - Jan.docx\" (if you wrote the Fan Fiction with two people, each person needs to hand it in!)</li>\n<li>Make sure you save it as a Microsoft Word document. No other file formats (Google Docs, Pages, PDF) are accepted. Everybody at the GSG has free access to Microsoft Office 365. You can install it for free on your PC, laptop, Android or iOS device, or use the online versions. If you forgot your Office 365 login details, ask the ICT people</li>\n<li>Hand in your Media File document in Magister Opdrachten \"Media File x\", where \"x\" is the proper Media File number. Make sure the file is no longer open in Word when you send it to Magister Opdrachten, or it may not upload properly.</li>\n</ul>\n"
