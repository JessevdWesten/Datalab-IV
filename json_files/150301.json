As a University of Applied Sciences, we define research as \"methodologically answering questions, leading to knowledge that helps to create products.\" For example, sometimes you need knowledge to select the most appropriate technique or framework or you need knowledge to create an advice report or a design. Sometimes these questions are small and can be answered within an hour. However, sometimes it takes weeks to answer the question. The research focusses on three subsequent parts: the problem, actually performing the research, and the solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis building block focusses on the first part: the problem. Sometimes the part of the problem is split into problem exploration and problem analysis. During problem exploration, you try to get to the root cause of the problem. During analysis you collect additional material to better understand the problem. Both parts combined lead to one or more research questions. The problem statement describes the same, not framed as a question, but as a statement describing the problem. Typically, you describe these subjects (problem statement and research questions) in the first chapter of your project report.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery project has a cause; there is a reason the project was initiated. The reason can be a question, a problem, a dream, an exploration, a challenge or a chance. The goal of problem exploration is to explore this initial reason and to understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: The terminology: problem statement, research question, main question, sub-questions are not clearly defined and sometimes even used interchangeably.</p>\n"

This initial problem description or question can unintendedly already include a solution. Or the problem description does not address the root problem, but a symptom of the problem. As an HBO-IT student, you should have a critical attitude. One method to get to the core of a problem is by repeatedly asking <em>Why</em>. Every time you ask <em>why</em>, you get to a problem on a different level of abstraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaddering is a method where you can go up and down in abstraction. Hence the name laddering. By asking the question <em>Why</em> you go up in abstraction. By asking the question <em>How</em> you go down. Going up and down the ladder can give you new ideas about the problem. In the following example, we show how this works.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br/>\nA client suggests updating the design of their website. By asking <em>Why,</em> you get to the reason behind the first question. A possible answer might be: \"because we do not get enough visitors on our website.\" From this point there are two options: You can go up further, or you can go down again. Both options can be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you go down, by asking <em>how</em>, you can get multiple answers. You can get more visitors by updating the design, because you think the design is not attractive. However, another possibility is using search engine optimization to get more page views. Another possibility is using advertisement, such as Google Adwords. Going up and down helps to broaden your scope. It can reveal that someone was stuck in one of the solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other option is going up again, by asking <em>why</em> again. This lead to the question: Why do you want more visitors on your website? A possible answer might be that the client wants to sell more products. From this point, you can go either up or down. When you go down, you ask: \"<em>how</em> can you sell more products?\" There might be more possibilities than the website. You can also ask: \"<em>why</em> do you want to sell more products?\"</p>\n<p>The method 5 Whys consists of asking the <em>Why</em> question 5 times. At a certain point, the reasons become too abstract to make sense anymore. The method was developed by Toyota. They used it in their factory to solve the <em>root cause</em> of the problem.</p>\n"

It is tempting to dive into solving a problem after hearing the first problem description. When you notice that your project group rushes into solutions without really understanding the problem and the context of the problem, remember to start working on the problem exploration first.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should also be aware of working too long on the problem exploration, resulting in less time for solving the problem. So, always keep in mind that when you understand the problem good enough, you can go on to the next phase. For example, if you have an 8-week project, you can limit the problem phase to 2 weeks.</p>\n<p>Especially the creative methods as restatement and dreaming are intended to result in new, creative and out-of-the-box ideas. However, sometimes it is difficult to express completely new ideas in a group of people. When this happens, good ideas might not be shared with others. If you want more information on such processes: search of group think or groupthink.</p>\n"
