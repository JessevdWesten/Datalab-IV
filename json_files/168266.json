The research report offers a standard structure for this, so that the most important parts are sure to be covered. In addition, it is important to pay attention to your writing style, so that your work comes across as professional and convincing.

You do not need to explain general IT knowledge, such as what an operating system is. Think back to when you just started this project: What knowledge on this subject did you not have at the time, which you did need to determine and implement your approach?</p>\n<p><strong>Related work</strong><br/>\nPart of the Background section can be Related work, if relevant. In this section, you can provide an overview of what has been done on this topic until now. What is already known? What does available work already show? What is the difference between your work and what has already been done?</p>\n<p>For a good example of Related Work from an actual research report, see the article <em><a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/bestanden/1033084/3341215.3358244.pdf\">Promoting Player Empathy for People Living with Poverty</a></em>, from building block <a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/166084/1_1_2_Choosing_your_approach_with_the_DOT_Framework\">1.1.2 \"Choosing your approach with the DOT Framework\".</a></p>\n<p>As an example for the Curiosity course: Suppose you are researching the types of players in your class. As part of the <em>Background</em>, you explain what types of players you mean (for example, based on Bartle's taxonomy of player types). As for <em>Related work</em>, it might be interesting to show existing research on the distribution of player types, for example in a certain country or on a certain platform. The difference with your research will be that you will look specifically at your class as a target group. Perhaps the distribution of player types is comparable to this existing work, but it could also be quite different, as your classmates are all HBO-IT students!</p>\n<p><strong>State of the art</strong><br/>\nWithin the Curiosity course, we are mainly doing research to familiarize ourselves with the domain of game development, but for more standard IT research (as part of the development of a product) it is always wise to take a good look at the <em>state of the art</em>. What existing solutions are already available? Can you reuse parts of it? What is already known from these existing solutions, such as problems you have to watch out for? What is and what is not suitable for your specific situation?</p>\n"

For example, briefly write at the end of the day the main things you have done, choices you have made, and other things that might be of interest for writing your report. </li>\n<li><strong>Freewriting: </strong>The idea of this technique is to just write freely about the topic / problem of your report (or a certain sub-topic within it), for a fixed amount of time, between 5 and 15 minutes. Write down everything that comes to mind. This can give you ideas and is also a useful tool to just start writing. </li>\n<li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Like with <em>freewriting</em>, you write for a set amount of time, but this time your aim is to write down everything, every detail you know about the topic. You may be able to use (part of) what you have written as a preliminary outline for your report. Or there may be certain points about which you want to continue <em>freewriting</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Native language:</strong> If your native language is not English, it can be helpful to start writing in your mother tongue, and translate it into English later on. This approach can help you get your ideas on paper more easily. </li>\n</ul>\n"

This way, you can also cluster ideas together that belong together, and distinguish the main points from less important matters.</li>\n<li><strong>Outline:</strong> Developing an outline (a \"skeleton\" of your work) can help you structure your report. In an outline, you write for each section of your report (introduction, methods, results, etc.) what you want to discuss there in a few sentences or keywords. This provides guidance when writing.</li>\n<li><strong>Topic sentence summary:</strong> Find the topic sentences of each paragraph. The topic sentence contains the main idea of that paragraph. In theory, all the topic sentences together should provide a summary of your report. Does this yield a logical story? Does it contain unnecessary things or are you missing a step in your chain of logic? Does a different order make more sense perhaps?<br/>\nIf there are more core sentences in one paragraph, it is better to split it up to increase readability.</li>\n<li><strong>Read like a reader</strong> who does not know the topic: Make sure you write for people who have no knowledge of the topic you are focusing on in your research. This means that you have to explain your argument step by step, explain more and give examples, so that the reader can follow your reasoning.</li>\n</ul>\n"
