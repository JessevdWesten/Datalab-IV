Wonder begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include the perspectives of his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These voices converge to portray a community as it struggles with differences, and challenges readers, both young and old, to wonder about the true nature of empathy, compassion, acceptance, friendship, and-ultimately-kindness. Auggie is a hero for the ages, one who proves that you can't blend in when you were born to stand out.</p>\n<p class=\"text-align-justify\">Wonder has been a New York Times bestseller for over 5 years in a row (with over 140 weeks as #1). It's received numerous national and international awards, including being one of Time magazines 100 Best Young Adult Books of All Time (January, 2015), and USA Today's Top 100 bestsellers. The movie Wonder is scheduled to be released on November 17th, 2017.</p>\n"
