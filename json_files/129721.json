It must cultivate an active care for the world and for those with whom we share it. Education must also be relevant in answering the big questions of the day.\"</p>\n<p>\"Technological solutions, political regulation or financial instruments alone cannot achieve sustainable development. It requires transforming the way people think and act.\"</p>\n<p>\"Education must fully assume its central role in helping people to forge more just, peaceful, tolerant and inclusive societies. It must give people the understanding, skills and values they need to cooperate in resolving the interconnected challenges of the 21st century.\"</p>\n<p>United World School sees a Global Citizen as someone who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is aware of the wider world.</li>\n<li>Has a sense of their role as a world citizen.</li>\n<li>Respects and values diversity.</li>\n<li>Wants to tackle social injustice.</li>\n<li>Believes that all children and young people have a right to an education.</li>\n<li>Takes action to make the world more equitable.</li>\n<li>Lives and promotes a sustainable way of life.</li>\n</ul>\n"

By dividing different topics/subjects you have the responsibility to educate eachother.</p>\n<p>Subjects (Netflix Docs):</p>\n<p>- Clothing Industry (<em>China Blue/True Cost</em>)</p>\n<p>- Food Waste and healthcare (<em>Global Waste</em>) (<em>Food Choices</em>) (<em>What the Health</em>)</p>\n<p>- Materialism (<em>Minimalism/Living on a Dollar</em>)</p>\n<p>- (Ab)Use of Animals (<em>Earthlings</em>) &amp; Meat Industry (<em>Cowspiracy</em>) &amp; Dolphins (<em>The Cove</em>) &amp; Ivory Industry (<em>The Ivory Game)</em></p>\n<p><em>-</em> Fair Trade (Alternative Trade in a conventional world) (After the harvest:Fighting hunger in the coffee lands) (Free vs. Fair Trade)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<p>During this cooperative assignment you work  with your group. This means that it is required for the group to be active, independent and responsible. You will learn when you effectively process the gathered information with the rest of the class. The teacher will guide this process as a coach.</p>\n<p><strong>Practicalities:</strong></p>\n<p>It is important that you choose a topic you want to work on with people you want to work with. However, it is also possible for the teacher to make the groups so they are well-balanced.</p>\n<p><strong>Method and activities:</strong></p>\n<p>Create groups of 6. With this group you choose a topic you want to investigate. Design a small research question. Educate yourselves. Create your paper and share it with your classmates.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/generated/s1152x864_6e472204101e8328cb3b2f3a44f02c34898e1212.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/generated/s960x720_6e472204101e8328cb3b2f3a44f02c34898e1212.jpg\"/> </a></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Content Paper</strong></p>\n<p>- Introduction</p>\n<p>- Your research question</p>\n<p>- Links to educational documentaries/films/texts (sources used)</p>\n<p>- List 5 possible thesis statements for an essay on this topic</p>\n<p>- Summary of your findings related to your research question (800-1000 words)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>(Everything should be in English ofcourse)</p>\n"
