But look carefully. Has the wall really been damaged? Can we really walk up these stairs?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">This house is situated in Purbeck and has been painted on by Nina Camplin and Antonia Philip during an art project week. The hole in the wall and everything inside is not for real. It is a painting. Because the artists have carefully painted the right shapes and have precisely applied shadow, the illusion of space has been created in the painting. It looks like there is a space of a few metres deep instead of a wall.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">The different ways in which an artist can create space or depth in a two dimensional artwork are called means of creating spatial illusion. Or: tools for suggestion of space.<br/>\nThe images in the movie below contain a great deal of suggestion of space. Have a look.<br/>\nSuch paintings contain a lot of illusionism, called trompe l'oeil.</span></p>\n<p><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YDQWpqYSxBU\" width=\"560\" class=\"video-item\"/></span></p>\n"

To suggest means: to create the impression of, to make it look like.<br/>\nThe most used way is <strong>overlapping</strong>. In this way you can show that one object is in front of another object. The object in the back is not totally visible because it is partly covered. This was applied by the Egyptians a long time ago. Look at image 1 below. This way of suggesting space can be easily applied by you. Charlotte from Havo 5 has done so too in her work in image 2.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/7/70300edcd02d53d418311d38d876302e938b4df8.jpg\" class=\"height-253-pixels width-336-pixels\"/>       <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/a/a33f296d74262d667e05e635c76fed07762bf3f7.jpg\" class=\"height-483-pixels width-300-pixels\"/></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">There is more to be seen in the same painting. Look at the brushes on the left, they seem to be rounded. You can see the brushes are not flat but they have some volume. Charlotte achieved this by <strong>applying light and shadow</strong>. By doing so, she gave them <strong>plasticity</strong>.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"image float-right\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/2/28a97e100bb7048f6a4dcf9b0d346cc65b88d6b3.gif\" class=\"height-405-pixels width-314-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>image 3</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">An object in a drawing is called plastic when it is made spatial by means of light and shadow.<br/>\nMost of the times a drawing seems to be going on behind the frame (the edge of the drawing). The depicted object or landscape is being cut off by the frame. This way of suggesting space is called: <strong>cut-off by frame</strong>. This is what you see in all the images above. In image 1 the legs are cut off. In image 2 the make-up box is cut off on the right side. And in image 3 the trees are cut off.</span></p>\n<p><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">Another way of suggesting space is <strong>size difference</strong>. Objects which have the same size in reality, seem to be smaller from a distance. This is to be seen in image 3 as well.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">The trees on the foreground are so big, they do not fit on the picture plane. The trees in the background are depicted smaller although in reality they have approximately the same size as the trees in the foreground.<br/>\nNext to that, the trees in the background are less detailed. For example the leaves are less clear. This tool of suggesting space is called: <strong>detail</strong>. As objects recede, details disappear.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"image float-right\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/0/048f06930fc668e45e8fd5d9c701d2e52e6613d4.jpg\" class=\"height-185-pixels width-300-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>image4</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><br/>\n<span class=\"font-size-18px\">This is clearly visible in the photograph of the leopard in image 4. The head of the tiger is contrasted and detailed, The tail is less contrasted and less detailed. The photographer has used contrast and detail on purpose to create more depth.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"image float-right\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/7/7ebf43b7af1645f754f6be32a96bbb02e277cdad.jpg\" class=\"height-164-pixels width-236-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>image 5</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\">A special way of using blurring is <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>. Colours and shapes diminish in the distance. This is visible when you are in a mountain landscape with the possibility of looking into the distance. The mountains nearby have got clear colours and shapes. In the distance the colours are more blue-grayish and the shapes are less clear, more vague. This effect is to be seen in image 5 too.<br/>\nBelow, you  can see two photographs in which atmospheric perspective is evident. There are lighter values in the background.<br/>\n     <br/>\nA special way of suggesting space is the use of <strong>repoussoir</strong>. This consists of a  big silhouette in the foreground combined with a much lighter background. The object in the foreground is cut off by the frame and the background is depicted in a smaller scale. This increases the spatial effect.<br/>\nIn image 6 the tree together with the background establishes a repoussoir effect.<br/>\nRepoussoir literally means: pushing away (the French word for pushing is pousser). The big dark shape on the foreground pushes the lighter background back, so to say.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-18px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/5/5a4c8d6e61d650e3e4ddd5ba5113af7da189663a.jpg\" class=\"height-236-pixels width-236-pixels\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA last tool to be discussed to suggest space is linear perspective. This is a special tool which is a little more complex and therefore will be discussed in the next chapter.</span></p>\n"
