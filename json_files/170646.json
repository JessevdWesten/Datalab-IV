                            "content": "<p>Data derived from satellite imagery is a form of Remote Sensing which utililizes multi-spectral imaging instruments (MSI) or hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Depending on the instrument on board, the satellite is capable of collecting optical images from various wavelenghts of light (called bands), reflected by the surface of the earth. These wavelengths may range from ultraviolot to far-infrared. This allows the gathering of data on subjects such as vegetation, humidity or chemical substances in the air. As sunlight hits the surface of the earth, the light is scattered and even though some of it is absored by particles in the atmosphere or the ground, much light may be reflected by an object on the surface or by water. This reflected light is captured by the MSI or HSI. Then from the amount of light and its particular bands of wavelength, data can be generated and as the satellite moves along its orbital path ultimately images may be composed. The incoiming light is split by a filter and focussed on two different planes; for Short Wave Infra-Red bands (SWIR) and for Visible and Near Infra-Red bands (VNIR). Each band is than individually seperated by stripe filters on top of the detectors (ESA, n.d.).    </p>\n<p>Depending on the type of light and instrument, the spatial resolution of the data collected by the satellites may vary. Some MSI's have a resolution of 50 meters, meaning that the data collected within that square of 50 by 50 meters is regared as the same for that confined surface. The smaller the resolution, the more accurate the image will be.  </p>\n<p>Currently several different MSI's are operating in satellites orbiting the planet. Below is a list of a few examples from which data may be used during this course:</p>\n<p><strong>Sentinel-1</strong> consists of two satellites orbitting the polar-regions. Regardless of the weather these satellites capture images for monitoring sea ice, oil spills, marine winds, waves and currents, land-use change and land deformation among others. They fly at a height of 700 km and revisit the same spot every six to twelve days. The saptial resolution depends on the mode it is operating in but varries from 5m x 20m to 20m x 40m.</p>\n<p><strong>Sentinel-2</strong> also consists of two satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) whch provide data on land change, vegetation and burned area's among others. The MSI captures light in thirteen different wavelengths (bands); visible, near infrared and far infrared with a spatial resolution of respectively 10m, 20m and 60m.  </p>\n<p><strong>Sentinel-3</strong> is a low orbit satellite. It's main objective is to measure sea surface topography, sea and land surface temperature, and sea and land surface color. The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) provides a set of 21 bands ranging from the visible to the near infrared light. The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Instrument (SLSTR) provides a set of eleven bands ranging from visible-near infrared to thermal infrared light. The Sentinel-3 has less than two days revisit time and provides imagery in a 300m spatial resolution for OLCI and 500-1000m resolution for SLSTR.</p>\n<p><strong>Sentinel-5P</strong> provides atmospheric measurements related to air quality, climate, ozone and UV radiation. Its data is used for monitoring the concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in the air. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of the satellite uses a wide range of bands ranging from ultraviolet to visible to infrared. The spatial resolution depends on the bands but ranges from 8 to 50km and is collected daily.</p>\n<p><strong>The Landsat Program</strong> was initiated in 1972 and is the longest running initiative for the acquisition of satellite imagery. This program consists of two satellites, Landsat 7 and the recently launched Landsat 8. Each satellite revisits the same spot every 16 days. However, they offset each other meaning that every spot is revisited every 8 days by either Landsat 7 or Landsat 8. The data collected may be used in agriculture, cartography, geology, forestry and surveillance. Landsat 8 utilizes an MSI with eight spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The thermal band however has a resolution of 120 meters (Sentinel Hub, n.d.).</p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-10px\">Source:</span> <span class=\"underline font-size-10px\">https://collections.sentinel-hub.com/</span></p>\n<figure class=\"image float-left\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/4/498a03d3b7997dc42a5f9f6d49cc0e587ba05cb8.jpg\" class=\"height-360-pixels width-640-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>Sentinel 2 (From ESA.int).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n"

Light travels as electromagnetic energy in the form of waves with each \"colour\" its own wavelength (see the image below). The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency and thus the more energy the wave contains. The elctromagnetic spectrum contains visible light we can see but also light we cannot see, namely gamma rays, X rays, ultraviolet, infrared, microwaves and radio waves. The MSI's in the satellites can use ultraviolet, visible and infrared light. Plants absorb red and blue light but reflect green light, which is why we perceive them as green, but they also reflect some parts of the infrared spectrum. A satellite images showing vegetation would therefore mostly be compiled from reflected infrared light.  </p>\n<div class=\"text-align-center\">\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Electromagnetic spectrum\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/a/a74459c7d4462fe11f349495e9b2e2f65b53d2a6.jpg\" class=\"height-332-pixels width-750-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>The electromagnetic spectrum (from miniphysics.com).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Each object has it's own spectral signature, meaning that each object reflects and absorbs different wavelengths of light.

However, an image composed from visible light of 0,5 \u03bcm would barely show any difference between the water, soil and vegetation since all three reflect roughly the same at that wavelength. Thus, using the correct wavelength, different subjects can be dinstinguished and observed with the use of a combination of different wavelengths.</p>\n<figure class=\"image float-left\"><img alt=\"Reflectance\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/b/b671f35cdb1c6040e311e22b2ad51e6d88accf92.webp\" class=\"height-203-pixels width-400-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>Percentage of reflectance of water, soil and vegetation (from grindgis.com).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"font-size-10px\">Source: <span class=\"underline\">https://www.sentinel-hub.com/docs/Custom_script_tutorial.pdf</span></span></p>\n"

The account however is free and usable for 30 days, after that it will expire.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note: several videos are added to this class which go over the most basic options of the EO Browser. These can be found in the tab \"Video instructions\" in the menu on the left.</strong></p>\n<p>To get to the browser, click on this button: <a class=\"content-link-button\" href=\"https://www.sentinel-hub.com/\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\">Sentinel Hub</a>.</p>\n<p>Click on \"Explore hub\" and then on \"Start exploring!\". This should get you to the EO browser where we'll do most of the work. Ofcourse, if you want to you can read through the information below the button or go through the menu on the left. There's a lot of interesting information available.</p>\n<p>Once you have entered the EO browser you should see a satellite map taking up most of the screen. By clicking and dragging you can change the location and scrolling up or down will allow you to zoom in. On the left you'll find the menu from where we'll generate satellite images and choose monitoring method. On the right, you'll find the bars that allow you to search specific locations, create timelapse video's but also generate statistical data among others.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do is decide what kind of information we are looking for; If we need information on for instance methane in the atmosphere, or ozone, we'll need data from the source Sentinel 5P. If we want information on vegetation cover, we'll need to select Sentinel 2. Next to each of the data sources in the menu is a question mark, clicking on that will reveal more information on resolution, revisit time and common usage (e.g. vegetation, phytoplankton, etc.). This is of course useful when to decide what data source to use. That means that you have think beforehand about the data you want to collect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you open the browser, the menu on the left should show the tab \"Discover\". This is where you select the proper data source. For now we'll want to monitor vegetation. Sentinel 2 is a good option for this but Sentinel 3 and Landsat can be used as well.</li>\n<li>Check the box of Sentinel 2 and if you want you can click on \"Advanced search\".</li>\n<li>Here you can select two additional sources; L1C and L2A. The former doesn't have atmospheric correction, the latter does and generates higher quality images most of the time. The downside is that data from this source is only available since March 2017, whereas the data from L1C is available since June 2015. This has of course consequences if you want data from 2016 which isn't available from L2A.</li>\n<li>You can also change the Max. cloud cover percentage. Images above the chosen percentage will not be selected if the cloud cover on the area's photographed is higher than the selected value. This allows you to filter images since cloud cover may render some images unusable. The lower the Max. cloud cover percentage the less images will be generated but most of them will be usefull.</li>\n<li>Head over to an area on the map of your own choosing, preferably with vegetation.</li>\n<li>Zoom in until you have a reasonably detailed image of the area.</li>\n<li>In the menu on the left, scroll down to the bottom and choose a time range. We'll make a short timelapse video of six images with a six month timegap between each.</li>\n<li>Change the time range to 2018-01-01 to 2018-01-30.</li>\n<li>We'll only need one image but the one month range will give us a choice of suitable images from which we'll select one.</li>\n<li>Then click on \"Search\" and you should see a list of results.</li>\n<li>Select the one you think suits best and click on \"Visualize\". A satellite image will generate and in the menu to the left you can select, under the tab \"Visualize\" a particular composition of bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compositions are formed from a combination of bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and depend on the function. Play around with the option before moving on.</li>\n<li>Since we want to see changes in the vegetation, click on NDVI. If you click on the dubble arrow pointing downwards you can get additional information. Finally, click on the pin (the left most symbol in the bar with the yellow icons) to pin this image. This image will be added to your pins which can be accesed at the top right of the menu.</li>\n<li>In the same way, add five more images to your pins. Leave six months inbetween each image and end at june 2020.</li>\n<li>You should see six different images in the menu to the left. If you want you can change the order if you didn't search chronologically and you can change the name as well as change the properties of the images or remove them altogether.</li>\n<li>Then click on the button \"Story\" in the bar with the yellow icons and a timelapse video will be generated from these six images.</li>\n<li>Here you can also add things such as a legend, a caption and a slide title.</li>\n<li>Finally, scroll down and you can save your timelapse as a .gif making it easy to share.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this part we have covered how to select the images you want as well as choose a composition suitable for the data you want to gather. Finally, from that data we have created a short timelapse video.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/2/296b816370a627463ef132f7820f03de4b7059e1.gif\" class=\"height-235-pixels width-500-pixels float-left\"/></p>\n<p> </p>\n"

The focus of this exercise is the visualization of <strong>nitrogen dioxide levels</strong> in the atmosphere layered over a satellite map of the world. This should allow for the identification of sources which produce large amounts of nitrogen dioxide. For this tutorial images from both the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P will be used.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the EO browser, head over to a, preferably, populated area and generate an image using the Sentinel-5P satellite.</li>\n<li>Click on NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) to gather data of this source. If you are unsure of the function of each satellite, clicking on the question mark behind each gives additional information.</li>\n<li>For the time range, you can choose a short interval of a month, or even a single day, then click on 'Search'.</li>\n<li>Then choose an image from the list of visualizations which suits the area your looking for. It is possible that there is no satellite data available for the particular dates you searched on. In that case, extend the time range.</li>\n<li>You may see overlapping blue footprints over the map of the world. These coincide with the visualizations and are the particular images generated from the data of the satellite sensor. Due to them overlapping it is possible to generate a large images consisting of several of these blue footprints with smooth transitions between them.</li>\n<li>Once you are satisfied with your images, pin it using this pin button <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/7/775b5384e446fdfb51343131926ef80a75ab9542.jpg\" class=\"height-39-pixels width-43-pixels\"/>. The data presented can be made clearer by placing it into a context. In this case, the image showing the nitrogen dioxide data will be made translucent and placed over a satellite image of the same area. This should allow you to link levels of nitrogen dioxide to the map.</li>\n<li>For this, use the exact same area and use Sentinel-2 with L1C and L2A both checked. You can leave the cloud coverage as is or change it. Find an appropriate time range and click 'Search'.</li>\n<li>Pin this image if you are satisfied. It is possible that the image doesn't cover the entire region your after. If that is the case, select another image form the list or generate an additional time range and select one that suits what you need. The image should cover another part of the area whilst overlapping with your first image, then pin it.</li>\n<li>Now that you have two or three images go to the 'Compare' tab. You should see all your pins.</li>\n<li>Click on the six small circles to the left of the image and drag the pin with nitrogendioxide data to the top of the list.</li>\n<li>Then change its opacity (you may have to select it from the drop-down menu at the right almost at the top which may also show split). When you lower the value you should start to see the satellite image of the area appearing. By working with layers and comparing them you can create custom overlay's which may allow you to easily link or compare data, depending on what you're after.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Create a timelapse of the changes in nitrogen dioxide levels in an area over several years.</p>\n<p>When you're satisfied with your images, answer the questions below.</p>\n"

In addition to that, they provide a variety of ecosystemservices related to industry, agriculture and recreation amonst others.</p>\n<p>The flooding of the Nile was a yearly event occurring in the months August through October and in ancient history was responsible for the highly fertile grounds downstream in the floodplains of the river. This supported agriculture and thus the ancient Egyptian civilization. With the encroaching human settlements on the banks of the River Nile in the centuries that followed, flooding became more of a hazard and control was called for. In 1970 the Aswan High Dam and it's large reservoir, Lake Nasser, was completed. The dam has great economic benefits for Egypt and the structure allows controlled flooding of certain agricultural areas. Additionally, massive amounts of electricity are generated by the turbines inside.  </p>\n<p>There are however, negative side-effects to the Aswan High Dam as well. Chief among them is a gradual decrease in fertile grounds, lowering the productivity of the agricultural lands which depend on the silt deposited by the floods. During the construction of the dam and the reservoir, thousands of people had to be relocated as well as the ancient Egyptian temple complex of Abu Symbal, which was a costly operation (Britannica, n.d.).</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/of4dOMnkN4g\" width=\"560\" class=\"video-item\"/></p>\n<p>Use the script below to find evidence on the function of Lake Nasser as a reservoir (Lefebvre <em>et al.</em> 2019).

Climate is ofcourse important but so is the morphology of the land, the vegetation and the presence or absence of urban area's. And while surface tempearture may seem uniform in a particular area, small varriations in temperature are common, especially when looking at a small scale. A canopy in a forest is never entirely closed and so light penetration is different in some area's compared to others. This allows more or less light to reach the ground and thus a higher surface temperature is reached in some places of the forestfloor. We can also see these differences in surface temperature in urban area's.</p>\n<p>In the EO browser, head over to the city of Ljubljana in Slovenia and run the script below (Gartner, n.d.). Use Landsat 8-9 L1 with a cloud cover of less than 10%. Consider changes the data to a periode in which air temperature was high. This will display the land surface temperature. The darker the area, the cooler, while brighter reds show a higher temperature. You may want to add additional information to the image. Click on the layer icon in the top right corner and add any addintional data you want. You may also want to use the 'Split' option in the 'Compare' menu. Or, you can add several layers of satellite imagery over each other and change the transparancy of some.</p>\n<pre>&#13;\n</pre>\n<div class=\"code\">//VERSION=3 (auto-converted from 1)&#13; //// STARTING OPTIONS&#13; // choose on basis of which band (B10 or B11) LST mapping will be done&#13; var band=\"B10\";&#13; &#13; // for analysis of one image (OE Browser), choose option=0.

Sunight is (partially) reflected or absorbed by the surface of the Earth. The reflected wavelengths are detected by the MSI and then used to generate data and construct images.</p>\n<p>In the EO Browser it is possible to generate an image in a particular \"colour\". When you have generated an image, you can select the type of visualisation depending on what you want to do with the data. You can select NDVI if you are interested in vegetation or NDMI for moisture in vegetation. When you click on these options you'll see the map change accordingly. These images are created by a combination of bands which are short ranges of wavelength. For instance, B4, the band for the colour red used by Sentinel-2, ranges between wavelengths 0,646 and 0,685 \u03bcm. In order to get an image in true colour (the way we see the world, the human eye has receptors for the colours red, blue and green) the bands for blue (B), red (R) and green (G) need to be combined. If instead you want to focus on the vegetation using NDVI, the bands for red and near infrared (B8) are combined. You can create these combinations yourself when you click on the button 'Custom' at the bottom of the Visualize list.</p>\n<p>When you click on the button you should see the screen shown in figure 1. It shows the different bands which you can drag and drop in the three circles at the bottom of the menu. Table 1 shows the wavelengths of these bands. These wavelenghts correspond to those used by Sentinel-2. Other satellites may use different bands.</p>\n<figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://maken.wikiwijs.nl/userfiles/1/1bc168c00b503a91d363b8946d812a425c6eaf4f.jpg\" class=\"height-216-pixels width-183-pixels\"/>\n<figcaption>Figure 1.

Bands and corresponding wavelengths used by Sentinel-2.

Be aware that the channel (R, G or B) also determines colour so a different order of these bands will generate another composite. By dragging and dropping other bands in the slots, the colours, and in extension the data displayed, will change. Manually managing the bands can be a powerful tool in getting the right data.</p>\n<p> </p>\n"

This will allow you to understand custom scripts from other users (of which many are publicly available on the internet) and make alterations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search and generate an image of a terrestrial area.</li>\n<li>Then head over to the 'Visualize' tab in the same menu and scroll down until you see 'Custom script'.</li>\n<li>When you click on it you should see a white box. This is where you'll input the code.</li>\n<li>Start by typing the following code: <strong>return [B04, B03, B02]</strong> and click on the 'Refresh' button. You'll need to do this whenever you want to run your script.</li>\n<li>You should see a grayscale image. This is because all of the bands are mixed in the same ratio. After all, B04, B03 and B02 stand for the red, green and blue band. The order of the code is important as well and corresponds to the channels. The first channel is the red one, the second the green one and the third is the blue one. This is different from the bands (B04, B03 and B02 in this case) and allows for even more flexibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A useful feature of most coding languages is that you can add comments to your lines of code. By adding <strong>//</strong> and then your comment, you can describe the function of a piece of code without it breaking your coding.    </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change your code to <strong>return [B04*2.5, B03*2.5, B02*2.5]</strong> and run your script. You should see a much clearer greyscale image appear. This is useful to generate images which are easier to read.</li>\n<li>Change your code again to <strong>return [B04*2.5, B03, B02]</strong> and you should see your image getting a reddish hue.</li>\n<li>Then, change your code to <strong>return [B04, B03*2,5, B02]</strong> and see what happens. Then finally change your code to <strong>return [B04,*2,5, B03, B02*2,5]</strong>. The 2,5 added to the particular bands is in fact a multiplication factor and changes the ratio between the bands. The higher the factor, the more emphasis is put on a band and therefore the colours of the image changes. It is possible to bring out certain features in an image while purposefully muting others by adding, removing and changing the factors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By creating a false colour composition, you can give something a particular colour other than the actual real-life colour.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you change the code to <strong>return [B08*2.5, B04*2.5, B03*2.5]</strong>, the vegetation will be displayed in red (B08 is near infrared).</li>\n<li>To make the vegetation stand out in green, instead put the B08 band in the second slot: <strong>return [B03*2.5, B08*2.5, B04*2.5]</strong>.</li>\n<li>However, bare ground is hardly distinguishable from the vegetation since it is generated in green as well. By changing the code to <strong>return [B03*3.5, B08*2.5, B04*4.5]</strong> the bare soil should be visible in a purplish colour. Because the red channel and the blue channel received higher multiplication factors, more emphasis was put on these two colours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By trying out different combinations and factors you'll eventually be able to generate satellite images which put emphasis on certain features while other features appear muted at the same time. This creates an easier to read and understand image and will greatly help in the analysis of your data. This is initially a process of trial and error but will eventually become much easier through experience. Try to play around with the bands and the multiplication factors and you'll eventually get to the image you need.</p>\n"

Therein differences in reflection are presented by pixels with more or less opacity. For instance, the more chlorofyll-a present, the greener a pixel is. In some cases however, a clearer distinction between values may make images much clearer. This is where a colourblend comes in. A colourblend is a small piece of script which lets you pick different colours for ranges of reflection. These ranges are written in the script, coupled with the colours for each range. Then the computer calculates the value of each pixel individually and gives it a corresponding colour.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the script for a colourblend for NDVI below. It shows the general formula with the bands and below it the actual script for a colorblend (with 3 ranges (0, 0.5 and 0.7) and 3 different colours, again with the R, G and B colours in the slots which correspond to the defined values). Whenever the value of a pixel is 0,5 it will be coloured according to the code [0, 1, 0] which is green. Whenever the value is 0,7, the colour of the pixel will be red (since the RGB code for that value is [1, 0, 0]. By understanding the basics, you can make adjustments to the range as well as the associated colours.</p>\n<div style=\"background:#eee; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:5px 10px;\">\n<p>var NDVI = index (B08, B04); //calculates the NDVI value for each pixel with the use band B08 and B04.</p>\n<p>return colorBlend<br/>\n// executes the ColorBlend function</p>\n<p><a>(NDVI,</a></p>\n<p><a>[0, 0.5, 0.7], // These are the NDVI values for which RGB colours will be created</a></p>\n<p>    [ [0, 0, 1],  // If the NDVI = 0, then the RGB colour = [0, 0, 1] , so just blue</p>\n<p>      [0, 1, 0], // If the NDVI =0,5, then the RGB colour = [0, 1, 0], so just green</p>\n<p>      [1, 0, 0], // If the NDVI = 0,7, then the RGB colour =[1, 0, 0], so just red</p>\n<p>    ]</p>\n<p>);</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Below are several other examples of colourblends you can use.

For waterquality it may be necessary to separate the water from the terrestrial area. The best option for this is to use the NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index). For values between zero and one, the water will look blue, whereas values below zero indicate a lack of water in the area. Because these values are calculated for each pixel individually, pixels with a NDWI value below zero can be given a Truecolour and no calculation for DOC (dissolved organic carbon), chlorophyll or any other subject is required.</p>\n<p>However, whenever water is present and thus NDWI is &gt; 0, these calculations are required. The following script represents this. It uses the border values and RGB values from the table below, provided by our partner, Nuno Pereira from the Polytechnic Institute of Beja.  </p>\n<p><em>Table 2.
