As a man and a woman prepare to have sex, various things happen to their bodies. The woman's vagina becomes moist and the man's penis fills with blood, making it stiff (an <strong>erection</strong>). During sex, the penis is inserted into the vagina and is moved backwards and forwards. Eventually semen is pumped out into the top of the vagina. This is called <strong>ejaculation</strong>.</p>\n<p>The semen flows into the cervix. Small movements of the uterus wall carry it up to the oviducts. Here, the sperm cells swim along the oviducts. If a sperm cells meets an egg cell, the sperm cell can burrow into it and fertilise it. In fertilisation, the <strong>nucleus</strong> of the sperm cell joins with the nucleus of the egg cell. Each nucleus contains half the instructions for a new human and so the baby will have features from both its mother and its father.</p>\n"
